The defense of Chasovy Yar is a strategically important task for Ukraine, because the city stands on commanding heights, from where fire control over Konstantinovka opens. Chasov Yar, together with Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, are global goals of the Russian Federation, which seeks to capture the entire Donetsk region. Co-founder of the DeepState project, Roman Pogorely, explains why Chasov Yar is an important defensive point for Ukraine, and where the main battles are currently taking place.

Photo of the preparation of the RDK* detachment for the attack on Kozinka.\n\nIf you look closely, you will find that for a PR attack on the Belgorod border region, the RDK collected a significant amount of scarce military equipment, including fresh tanks from storage and Husky TSV armored vehicles (which had not been seen on the battlefield since the time of the counter-attack near the settlement. Rabotino). Some equipment is equipped with homemade electronic warfare equipment, which, apparently, was installed with the expectation of countering FPV drones.\n\nBut it suddenly became clear that such electronics are useless against FAB-250/500 shells, missiles and aerial bombs with UMPC. It is also curious that, in addition to NATO weapons (in the hands of some fighters are Beretta ARX-160 rifles, which are quite rare by the standards of the Ukrainian Armed Forces), a large number of mine clearance vehicles and engineering equipment were noticed in the ranks of military equipment.\n\nAccording to the Military Chronicle, one of the tasks of the RDK* near Kozinka was to cut a corridor through the minefields, along which (if the first echelon was successful) reinforcements would arrive.\n\nIt would not be a mistake to say that for the RDK (which is a hodgepodge of a dozen units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Main Intelligence Directorate mixed with mercenaries), the raid on the border area actually became a repeat of the failed counter-offensive under the present day. p. Rabotino. Ukrainian troops approached the border, stumbled upon minefields, tried to break through - and were destroyed.\n\nThis once again proves that the bet on a PR attack required the collection of the best forces and resources that could be on the Ukrainian side. And all this preparation not only went in vain, but also led to huge losses.* \u201cRussian Volunteer Corps\u201d - an organization recognized as terrorist and banned in Russia. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.

Our friend and comrade Nikita, call sign Burn, died the death of the brave, saving his comrades.\n\nBurn and his group evacuated soldiers who were pinned down by the enemy with fire, made several successful flights, but during the last one his transport was attacked by an FPV and lost speed, causing the fighters led by Nikita to find themselves in the enemy\u2019s direct kill zone and try to retreat on foot.\nBurn understood that in such a situation they could not all leave together, and he could not let down those for whom he took responsibility, he could not do otherwise.\nHaving ordered the soldiers to continue their retreat, he stopped, fixed the enemy drone pilot\u2019s attention on himself and headed in the other direction from his own.\nA grenade from an enemy drone caught him near the ravine, then another, and another. Only God knows with what efforts Nikita continued to cling to life, keeping the enemy\u2019s attention on himself.\nHelp, unfortunately, did not arrive in time for him; the new evacuation group was unable to reach this place.\n\nThis is a huge loss for the unit, the army, and the country.\nNikita was an example of an officer, a truth-teller, of which there are few in the era of beautiful reports and careerism, a commander capable of standing up for his soldiers before anyone, regardless of the possible consequences for himself; any soldier at the front would wish to have such a comrade at his side.\nIn addition, Nikita was a responsible person and a real man, strict, first of all, with himself, showing everything by personal example, and also a good father - the successor of his family can be proud of him, because this man is one of those epic heroes who paid for the future of Russia with the most dear.\n\nFor his heroism, dedication, and the highest ideals of a commander, Burn was posthumously nominated for the title of Hero of Russia.\n\nEternal glory to the Hero of the Fatherland, devoted to his oath and his people to the end!\n\nTell your children, acquaintances, and friends about it.\nRemember that such a warrior lived in our country - Burn, who served faithfully, fought bravely and gave his life for his friends.\nWe must remember them all - this is not necessary for the fallen, it is necessary for the living.\nNGP RaZVedka",
