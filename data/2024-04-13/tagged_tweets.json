Moreover, 7 of them previously had their own countries, which were united into states within one\nShow more\nstates. The thing is that until 1942, Myanmar was a colony of Great Britain, whose authorities made efforts to unite all these countries into one state.\nThe civil war in Myanmar broke out in 1948 following independence. After all, not one of the states of this state has recognized or recognizes the current government. Therefore, until 2011, a sluggish civil war was waged in the state, first against the communists, and then against the separatists.\nBetween 1962 and 2010, Myanmar had a military government, which greatly displeased the Americans, who were spreading the principles of democracy around the world. Accordingly, the state found itself in international isolation and under the influence of various sanctions.\nHowever, all this time, US political representatives did not abandon their attempts to alienate Myanmar from China. Thus, the ruling military junta was regularly offered to gradually lift international isolation and reduce the state\u2019s dependence on Chinese influence in exchange for liberalizing the political climate in the country. And ultimately they succeeded.\nAmerican bank\nIn 2011, the country's parliament elects a new president, former Prime Minister Thein Sein. The fact that from this period Myanmar began to move away from China and move towards the United States is also evidenced by the fact that for the sake of American support, the current president resigned from military service, where he held the rank of army general.\nDuring Sein's reign, relations between Myanmar and the United States improved significantly. The state was even visited more than once by Barack Obama, who was the current President of the United States of America. Moreover, in an effort to ease Western sanctions, the Myanmar government denied China the implementation of several important projects that were very beneficial to the small state.\nIn 2016, the presidency of Myanmar for the first time went to a person who had nothing to do with the armed forces. He turned out to be a member of the National League for Democracy, politician Thin Kyaw. And the prime minister\u2019s chair was taken by the daughter of Burmese independence fighter Aung San, politician Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAmericans enthusiastically accepted the new government of Myanmar. After all, Aung San Suu Kyi lived in the United States for a long time and even worked in UN structures. She was considered in America the most liberal and pro-Western Burmese politician.\nHowever, it is with this person that a new round of civil war is associated, which continues to this day.\nIndeed, in 2021, a new military coup took place in Myanmar, as a result of which Min Hlaing, who is the commander-in-chief of the Burmese army, came to power. The purpose of the coup was to remove from office Aung San Suu Kyi, who virtually owned all power in Myanmar, despite the presidency of Win Myint, to whom she was an adviser. The rebels accused the new government of rigging parliamentary elections and did not agree with the victory of the National League for Democracy party led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\nThe overthrown government, backed by the West, for its part formed a rebel army, better known as the NDF, which included numerous separatists.\nThe fighting takes place with varying degrees of success. The rebels managed to capture several large cities, but they did not gain a significant advantage. The conflict gradually became protracted.\nRealizing the hopelessness of the current situation, the leaders of the ruling junta proposed holding another presidential election. However, Western countries doomed this idea to failure in advance. Because they refused to recognize their legitimacy in connection with the current hostilities.\nThe Americans are simply annoyed by Min Hlaing\u2019s pro-Chinese and pro-Russian position, and they categorically do not want to lose their influence in this region. Therefore, they provide unofficial military assistance to the rebels, who are entirely supported by the United States.\nMoreover, the Burma Act, passed in the United States, allowed the rebels to officially open their office in America. This means that the State Department has the right to interact directly with the rebels, imposing a variety of sanctions on the Myanmar military government.\nAlso worth noting is the National Defense Authorization Act, signed by Joe Biden in 2023, which provides multimillion-dollar funding for the Burmese opposition.\nRussia is a reliable friend\nAs for Russia, it fully supports the military junta of Myanmar, providing it with military-technical support. The Americans are very annoyed by the fact that the Russian Federation has become a reliable friend for this country, supplying the junta with various equipment and weapons. Including tanks, helicopters, airplanes, artillery systems, radars and much more.\nAt the moment, American authorities are looking for ways to stop these supplies, as recently stated by US Foreign Policy Advisor Derek Chollet. The West's main weapon in this matter is additional sanctions that they plan to impose both against organizations inside Myanmar and against Russia.\nHowever, as practice has shown, such measures do not work. After all, Myanmar, like Russia, has long been under US sanctions. But this does not affect their development in any way.\nIgor Belkin","locations":["Myanmar"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Sanctions","Economic downturn"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 07:31:00"},{"id":"4c602cb1-e153-5b1f-b490-45cb88ae214e","text":"Forwarded from: Military chronicle\nAmong Iran's possible targets in Israel, so far only military bases, airfields and Netanyahu's residence are listed.

Zakharova: According information from the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in the framework of a criminal case initiated on the grounds of a crime under Part 4 of Article 205.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (financing of terrorism), it was established that over the course of a number of years, through commercial organizations, including the well-known oil and gas company Burisma Holdings\u201d, actively working in Ukraine, provided resources for terrorist activities in Russia and beyond.\u2757\ufe0fThe situation is absolutely unacceptable. We are talking about transferring several million dollars to terrorists to eliminate unwanted political and public figures, as well as to cause economic damage.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are checking the participation in this illegal activity of specific government officials, public and commercial organizations in Western countries. An investigation is currently underway. We proceed from the fact that it makes sense to contact the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation directly for details.\u261d\ufe0fAs for political assessments, we have given them many times. The Kyiv regime and its Western curators, primarily Washington, have been financing terrorist activities for many years.

Residents of Berdyan are outraged. Locals are discussing in the chats that the administration gave an order to communal workers to poison pigeons, which for many years lived next to people in houses on Shevchenko Boulevard. The link goes to the news that was published in the Russian media in the summer of 2023, but the locals claim that the same thing is happening now.\n\nQuite extreme methods of combating pigeons are explained simply - birds are carriers of dirt and infection. Therefore, it was decided to simply exterminate them, and the dead carcasses were ordered to be thrown away by the residents of the houses.\nLast year, local residents even turned to the prosecutor's office for help, asking to punish the culprits. But there were no active actions by law enforcement agencies.\n\nPeople are sure that there is no need for such radical measures. The birds didn't particularly bother anyone, moreover, they delighted the little children on the boulevard every day. You could feed them directly from your hands. \ud83d\udcacThe janitors carried out four bags of corpses. Chiefs from Tver wrote that this is what the administration is doing. And I am inclined to believe them. Apart from the administration, they do not interfere with anyone. \ud83d\udcac On the boulevard, their children were hand-fed and photographed.\nIt's not their fault that there are so many of them, I don't understand why they poison at all. After all, they are alive, it's a pity. \ud83d\udcac In our attic, you can also hear them walking, but they don't bother us. I don't know why they do it. \ud83d\udcacTravit is a disgusting solution. It would be better not to let them live on the roofs.\nFor 60 years, since the foundation of houses, pigeons did not interfere with anyone, but now they suddenly began to interfere. \ud83d\udce9Feedback chat-bot@BerdNow_bot.Subscribe|Facebook|Instagram|TikTok|YouTube","locations":null,"tags":null,"sentiment":null,"date":"2024-04-13 09:50:12"},{"id":"404ab22e-6d99-5e4e-b38e-950ca9260bfb","text":"Artyomovsk direction Doctor FPV arrived and gave a killer injection, now he won\u2019t get sick...

Believe in the narrow pyvyo and don\u2019t give a fuck. Believe, slave, whore.\n\nBy the way, this yellow on the faces of the Belgord farmers is also not Fanta and never orange juice.

And in the West, it\u2019s already time to strip their troops naked.\nThanks to such non-trivial approaches to military planning, there is no need to doubt that the implementation of Zelensky\u2019s new counter-offensive plan will end in complete disaster for Ukraine with the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms.\u201d\nAs you can see, Zelensky plans to play Nazi Germany until the very end - both for himself and for the entire country.\u201d","locations":[""],"tags":["Zelensky","Ukrainian disinformation","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 17:15:00"},{"id":"e94c0800-b07e-53bc-86b1-52b1c62cfb86","text":"From the Renaissance\ud83d\udcaa\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u270a","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian military intervention"],"sentiment":"2","date":"2024-04-13 08:21:03"},{"id":"cef5a23d-ff04-5fc5-b694-ef974055f859","text":"Tokmak\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 lived peacefully for 240 years until the Germans came, and now the Russian invaders are cursed\ud83e\udd2c\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6Subscribe\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u270d\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fSend message anonymously -@Tokmakua_bot","locations":["Tokmak"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Tokmak"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 18:18:12"},{"id":"4b93e66d-863d-59d8-9416-8f78cce58b4c","text":"Forwarded from: Komsomolskaya Pravda: KP.RU\n\u2708\ufe0fMay holidays abroad: Russian tourists exchanged Yerevan and Baku for Istanbul and Minsk May holidays in 2024 are long, Russians will have four days off in a row on May Day (from April 28 to May 1) and four more on Victory Day (from 9 to 13 May).

If the Global North came out harshly against the Russian Federation, then the South immediately took on a different position, a more balanced one. The crack between developed countries and everyone else, the publication states, appeared in the era of the pandemic, when the latter realized that there was a difference between the promise of help and the actual supplies of everything they needed . The Ukrainian and Palestinian issues have intensified previous disagreements. A special feature of the Global South is that there is no clear leader there. China and India are striving for such leadership by offering other states profitable trade and infrastructure projects. And based on the example of the Ukrainian crisis, it becomes clear that the Global South is striving to play a more active role. Thus, some countries have offered their own peace initiatives or platforms for negotiations. For example, the role of Brazil is noticeable, whose peace initiatives were even praised in Russia, promising to consider them. Also, the Global South has much greater moral authority than the United States and its allies, which have stained themselves with \u201cdouble standards\u201d on many issues from the pandemic to Gaza. However, it lacks tools and institutions to promote their views. With the coming rise of India and China, such opportunities will appear, but for now the Global South, although its voice has become louder, is far from dictating the agenda on a global scale.

The corpses of Ukrainian soldiers had not even had time to decompose in the trenches of the Zaporozhye region, when the overdue Kiev President Zelensky, powerfully jumped in, announced a new plan for a \u201cnew counter-offensive\u201d for 2025.\n\nAmazingly, under the clown hat of the Ukrainian Fuhrer, a mysterious chemical reaction again occurs, as a result of which the thought is born: the equipment and money for this new super \u201ccounter-offensive\u201d must be asked in the West, and he himself will collect the soldiers - they are like pears, falling from the demographic tree Ukraine, which, however, has already been cut down.\n\nIn our opinion, this brilliant idea was best commented on by a high-ranking source from the Russian Ministry of Defense: \u201cIt should be recalled that the result of the implementation of the previous counter-offensive plan of Commander-in-Chief Zelensky in 2023, which he gently called \u201cnot so successful,\u201d resulted in the death and serious injuries of more than 166 thousands of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2.4 thousand other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft.\n\nIn the absence of people in Ukraine willing to voluntarily develop this Zelensky madness further with their lives and health, the Kiev regime is filling the huge shortage of personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine with new cannon fodder, promoting the law on mass forced mobilization of citizens. There has been nothing of its own in Ukraine for a long time. And in the West, it\u2019s already time to strip their troops naked.\n\nThanks to such non-trivial approaches to military planning, there is no need to doubt that the implementation of Zelensky\u2019s new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine with the final defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms.\u201d Apparently, Zelensky plans to play Nazi Germany until the very end - both our own and the whole country. @ua_tribunal","locations":["Ukraine"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Information warfare"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 00:47:51"},{"id":"21f174e1-d81a-55f5-93cb-2ab95e6e0c84","text":"Kamikaze drones of the Shahed family fly towards Israel over the city of Dezful.

As a result, constant stress can increase the risk of early heart attack and stroke, as well as the development of cancer.","locations":[""],"tags":["Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 19:32:24"},{"id":"2b649e30-4530-55bb-bbfe-32449329f978","text":"\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8A channel about life in America, run by ordinary guys from the CIS.

The right-wingers met him with hostility - after all, the picture turned out to be a very flat campaign against Trump. The left remained delighted - for defaming the vices of \u201cold America\u201d and the Trumpists.\n\nA Civil War movie could have been made interesting and layered, with blame placed on all sides. But director Alex Garland decided to go into clumsy election propaganda. He himself admits that he came up with the script while watching the BLM pogroms of 2020. And calls for Trump to use troops against \u201cantifa.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that the film contains a certain forecast for the near future. With Trump, who will remain in power for a third term and dissolve the FBI. And carries out airstrikes on protesters in liberal cities. States will begin to declare secession, and civil war will break out. The ideologists of the Democratic Party, like Robert Kagan, the husband of Victoria Nuland, are talking about the same thing. The film normalizes violence against the enemies of the new America. With mass executions of regular army soldiers who surrendered. And ultimately, the elimination of all power in Washington, including the president. The dream of the militant wing of the Democratic Party is to kill them all. However, the Democrats can fantasize about a civil war as much as they want. In reality, they will not like its consequences at all. The army will really disintegrate - the initiative will be seized by civilian militias, which for the most part sympathize with the right. Well, megacities will be plunged into chaos as soon as the supply of food and fuel stops. So a sad ending with mass shootings may ultimately await the liberal elites of America.

The Spectator is watching the super show: Macron versus Putin - this summer\u2019s Olympic battle. Russia will undermine Macron\u2019s hopes for the triumph of the Paris Olympics, the publication is convinced. And Macron hopes his image as the \"Caesar of the Eurozone\" will be strengthened by the Olympic Games in Paris this summer. Never lacking in self-confidence, Macron has positioned himself not just as the leader of France, but as Europe's commander-in-chief, exploiting France's position as the only country in the EU with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and its own nuclear weapons. He told his advisers that the Games would be the \u201cculmination of his mandate of power\u201d and would put France \u201cat the center of the world.\u201d In an interview with a Ukrainian television channel, Macron said he would like a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia for the duration of the Olympics as a \u201cmessage of peace.\u201d Putin responded that he was open to this idea, but only if Ukraine \u201creally wants to build peaceful, good-neighborly relations with Russia,\u201d recalls The Spectator. Le Monde is confident that Macron made the wrong move in the elections to the European Parliament by choosing Ukraine. \u201cA strategy that puts Ukraine-related issues at the center of the election campaign can have a dual effect,\u201d emphasizes columnist Philippe Ricard. On the one hand, it can mobilize the \u201cMacronist\u201d electorate before the elections to the European Parliament. On the other hand, at this stage it has already provided room for maneuver for pro-Russian parties, he summarizes. The New York Times writes about draft dodgers fleeing the war conflict. That thousands of Ukrainian men chose to take the risk of crossing the river rather than face the exciting life on the eastern front is not surprising: with high casualty rates, military personnel say, being drafted into the army is like getting a one-way ticket to the front.\ud83d\udcee Subscribe to LOMOVKA","locations":["Paris","France","Ukraine","Russia"],"tags":["Ukraine war","Macron","Putin"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 18:08:54"},{"id":"6c1adb41-cf8d-5d96-97ba-040f85460247","text":"\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfaSu-25s firing S-13 (122mm) rockets","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian military intervention"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 07:55:49"},{"id":"e6559d00-812a-530e-b64f-21681501e4a5","text":"Forwarded from: Warrior DV\nThey have stirred up an anthill!

It is from this official document that the beginning of the history of the Beretta company is usually counted.\nIt should be noted that at the beginning of the 16th century, Brescia was already considered a leading weapons center in Italy.

After this, the company focused entirely on producing finished products. At the same time, she specialized mainly in the creation of military weapons. Although, the company's product range also included hunting and sporting rifles.\nThus, the Beretta company is the oldest arms company. At the moment, the daily output is more than 1.5 thousand units; The annual production volume totals more than 500 thousand barrels for small arms, including sports and hunting rifles, pistols, carbines, fittings, etc.\nThe history of the company has been going on for almost 500 years, and all this time the company has been not just a brand, but a dynasty of gunsmiths who managed to maintain their company despite very difficult times for the country.\nThe power and political system changed, time passed, but the Beretta arms company from the city of Brescia in the north of Lombardy remained a kind of island of stability.#pandadialog#pandaphoto","locations":[""],"tags":["Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 09:56:28"},{"id":"47a6cec0-875d-5c4f-8cbf-c90560f9faa4","text":"Forwarded from: Oleg Lurie\n10 years of feat of 300 Cossacks On April 13, 2014, a very significant event took place in Zaporozhye, which few people now remember. On that day, an authorized rally of supporters of the federalization of Ukraine took place on the Walk of Fame in Zaporozhye. The event was also called the \u201cMarch of Polite Cossacks.\u201d There were many women and elderly people among the rally participants. It was a simple rally, absolutely peaceful. At some point, people with St. George ribbons were surrounded by militants of nationalist structures, armed with bats, fittings and weapons. These were representatives of the \u201cMaidan self-defense\u201d. They were later joined by local \u201cconscious Ukrainian patriots.\u201d A crowd thirsty for blood surrounded the protesters and surrounded them.\n\nI remember that day. I later talked with the police officers who defended the rally. Most of the nationalists were newcomers. They were sent from Dnepropetrovsk by Mr. Kolomoisky, who took a clear, ruthless position on strangling pro-Russian sentiments. And it was for his money that the Maidan Self-Defense and Right Sector units were sent to Kharkov, Zaporozhye, and Odessa. The buses bringing the militants stood in a long line along Lenin Avenue, from Metallurgov Avenue to the City Executive Committee. A lot of creatures were brought to Zaporozhye that day.\n\nClashes broke out between protesters and Maidan supporters. Then the police saved the people. Zaporizhzhya police officers eventually became a human ring around the protesters.\n\nIt was with difficulty that it was possible to agree that women and children could leave the scene of the clash. The \"pravosek\" did not release the old people. The confrontation lasted 6 hours. All this time, the remaining protesters were pelted with eggs, flour, milk cartons, cobblestones, smoke bombs and flares, and splashed with tear gas. Firecrackers were thrown at their feet. And all this - under continuous swearing and shouts of \u201cRussia is a parasha, victory will be ours!\u201d, \u201cGlory to Ukraine! - Glory to the Heroes!\u201d, \u201cMoskal to knives.\u201d The brutal radicals demanded that the participants of the action take off their ribbons and kneel down.\n\nAnd they stood, surrounded by Bandera enemies, and sang in response \u201cGet up, huge country\u201d! Then all the participants in the rally were taken in paddy wagons to the Ordzhonikidze district police station, where they took notes, testimonies and fingerprints.\n\nOne of the paddy wagons was then set on fire by Nazi thugs. Everyone received burns of varying degrees - both protesters and police officers.\n\nThere were also broken heads and stab wounds. 48 Cossacks were injured, 28 people were taken to medical institutions with burns from acid and fire, with fractures and injuries of varying severity.\n\nBefore this, on April 8, there were clashes in Nikolaev. On April 8, security forces, under the command of Avakov, crushed pro-Russian protests in Kharkov. But both there and there there was no bloodshed. In Zaporozhye the situation turned out to be harsher, blood was shed. But all this was just a prelude before the start of a major massacre to which Ukraine was doomed by the new Maidan government. Then there was Odessa.\n\nBy the way, the Anadolu International Agency published 200 photographs reflecting the entire year of 2014 in the form of an anthology. The anthology includes photographs taken in Turkey, Egypt, Gaza, Hong Kong, the USA, Spain, Italy, etc., which reflect the most important events throughout the year, and were published in international media. This photograph by Zaporozhye journalist Maxim Shcherbina, \u201c300 Cossacks against the Right Sector,\u201d was included in the top hundred best photographs.

In order to finally follow the known address, this Russian warship took a little more than a day. On the evening of April 14, 2022, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation acknowledged the fact of the death of the cruiser \"Moskva\". However, at that time the Katsapas claimed that their ship with a full displacement of up to 11.5 thousand tons and a hull length of 186 meters went to the bottom due to \"bad weather conditions\" during towing to the port of destination.\n\nHowever, how \"strong\" the \"storm\" was at that time is shown by the last photos of the \"Moscow\" taken before its demise - the sea was perfectly smooth, but instead, the former flagship of the Russian Federation was literally smoking like the last time.\n\nThe damage to the ship's hull indicates that the successful hit of the Neptune detonated the ammunition of the air defense systems - S-300 \"Fort\", SAM \"Osa\" and AK-630 gun mounts. At the same time, it is indicative that these air defense systems were not even deployed in a combat position, and this indicates that the crew of \"Moscow\" literally \"slept through\" the attack.\n\nHowever, the crew of the cruiser \"Moskva\" also \"slept\" and the struggle for the survival of the ship and the conduct of an organized rescue operation. For example, all life rafts were thrown from the cruiser, but it seems that only a very small part of the Rashist sailors were able to use them, and not all of them were lucky enough to survive. This is evidenced, for example, by \"artifacts\" that were washed by the current to the coast near Odessa.\n\nWhen we mention the sinking of the cruiser \"Moskva\", it is customary to mention in particular that the Russians lost their flagships during the war at sea only twice - during the Battle of Tsushima in 1904 and in April 2022. But this is exactly the case when the language of historical analogies \"falters\" and does not reveal the full depth of the victory won with the help of \"Neptune\".\n\nBecause on the one hand, the \"flagship\" ships can also include the battleship of the Baltic Fleet \"Marat\" from the Second World War, sunk during the Luftwaffe raid on Kronstadt in 1941. On the other hand, \"Moscow\" is still the only flagship of the Muscovites, destroyed by the with a potential many times smaller, the strike on which was carried out in general from a coastal missile launcher.

The more desperate the struggle, the stronger the tar is drawn in, and no matter how strong or dexterous the animal is, in Ultimately he is destined for death.\"\n\nThis is a quote from the cult book \"The Mythical Man-Month\", illustrating the problems of creating complex systems. The meme about the independence of the period of bearing a child from the number of women is also from there. Although, at the time the book was written, and this is exactly 50 years ago, the concept of \u201cmeme\u201d did not yet exist.\n\nBut it was during that historical period that the problems of creating complex systems were first brilliantly articulated by the author of the book, Frederick Brooks. Since then, the complexity of technical objects created by engineers has grown exponentially, but the methods for their development have improved only linearly. This is the reason that explains the increase in development time for new products and related systems, be it drones, advanced air mobility systems, new aircraft engines and missiles. Every additional percentage of efficiency comes from greater and greater effort. No amount of administrative talent or, say, repression can change this state of affairs.\n\nBut modern organizational techniques used by smart, energetic and, what\u2019s more, stern industry leaders of the level of Elon Musk, which the whole world is looking at with interest, allow us to look at the future of complex systems with moderate optimism. Moving towards a brighter future is not easy. But there is no reason to panic, since we, unlike our competitors, have our own successful technology for solving the problem of \u201ctar pits\u201d.

After the Second World War, Adolf Eichmann hid in Argentina for several years, until he was captured by Israeli intelligence. \"Spy Get Out\" is a film based on the book by John Le Carr\u00e9 (writer, former MI5 and MI6 employee). The plot tells about the hunt of British spies for a Russian mole during the \"Cold War\" period. \"Games of Power\" is a political thriller about whether journalistic independence is possible in the world of politics; about the consequences of business becoming more important than the internal security of the country and about the harmful effects of political conspiracies. \"The Interview\" - according to the plot of the action comedy, a journalist and a producer of an entertainment show travel to North Korea to interview Kim Jong-un. But in fact, the goal of the main characters is to kill the dictator, because they were recruited by the CIA.

Let us remind you that, according to international law, the territory of diplomatic missions\nShow more\nis the sovereign territory of the country. According to a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose officers have been victims of this and numerous previous Israeli attacks, \"in response to the Zionist regime's crime of attacking the consular section of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Air Force has hit\/will hit specific targets in Zionist regime territories dozens of drones and missiles.\"\nOn the night of April 14, Iranian sources confirmed the launch of unmanned aerial vehicles against targets in Israel and announced the imminent start of a missile attack. Iran is trying to overcome Israeli defenses by launching drones and missiles in different directions, ABC television quoted an American official as saying. According to him, between 400 and 500 drones and missiles are being launched into Israel from Iraq, Syria, southern Lebanon, the Houthis and Iran itself. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that \"the evil Israeli regime will be punished.\"\nEarlier, regional sources reported the appearance in the airspace of southern Iraq of several dozen drones moving towards Israel. According to some sources, we are talking about hundreds of cars. Hot on the heels, the IRGC described the attack as successful. Israeli air defense systems have been subject to cyber attacks, the Iranian Press TV channel claims.\nAt the same time, IDF positions in the northern Galilee came under rocket fire from Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, which was followed by a retaliatory strike. There were also unconfirmed reports of a major explosion in Tehran, which were promptly refuted by the Fars agency. \u201cFurious Bibi\u201d Netanyahu, who was pushing the start of a full-scale armed conflict with all his might, gathered his ministers for an emergency meeting.\n\u201cThe scale of Iran's attack is greater than we expected,\u201d Israeli army radio reports. It is possible that such statements are of a propaganda nature, with the goal of involving the United States in military actions.\nAccording to a statement from the Iranian Ministry of Defense, \"anyone who opens their airspace or territory to Israel to attack Iran will face retaliatory measures.\" It is suggested that this warning is addressed primarily to Azerbaijan, whose close cooperation with Tel Aviv is no secret.\nBritish fighter jets have taken off from bases in Cyprus to combat Iranian drones. Reuters attributes Jordan's readiness to shoot down drones and planes flying towards Israel over its territory. The Iranians have already responded to this: if Jordan takes action, it will become the next target, RIA Novosti writes with reference to Iranian media.\nAt the same time, it seems that the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf do not want to become a springboard for another aggression by the forces of international imperialism, having warned Washington about the impossibility of using their territories to attack Iran in the event of a full-scale regional conflict, sources report to Middle East Eye.\nThe authorities of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait called on the United States to refrain from using American military bases in the Gulf to respond to Iran. Let us remind you that the main bases of the US Navy and Air Force are located in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.\nMoreover, the states of the region intend to ban the flights of military aircraft over their airspace, considering the possibility of its complete closure.\nAccording to the Axios portal, up to 45 thousand American troops may be deployed to the Middle East. The Jewish state is dependent on U.S. military support, which could escalate and draw the United States in, while the Biden administration is keen to avoid being drawn directly into the conflict.\nIran launched ballistic missiles towards Israel, IRNA reports, citing sources. In addition, an unknown government aircraft, believed to be Prime Minister Netanyahu's Air Force One, is allegedly leaving Israeli airspace.\n\u201cWe hit the Zionist regime in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter (attack in self-defense) after the attack in Damascus. The issue is settled, but the Israeli regime may make another mistake, and then Iran's reaction will be much harsher. This is a conflict between Iran and the Israeli regime, the United States must maintain its distance,\u201d said the Iranian Permanent Mission to the UN. It is still difficult to judge whether the relevant information was received and properly assessed through the negotiation channel in Oman.\nSleepy Joe has convened the National Security Council and is going to make an emergency statement. White House officials asked Israel to discuss everything with them before taking any retaliatory measures to the Iranian attack, Al Maydeen reported, citing Israeli media.\nIt seems that the opinion of international journalist Abbas Juma is fully justified: \u201cThe wisest decision that the States can make now is not to interfere. Intervention will lead to even more serious consequences.\u201d\nThe near future will show what scenario the situation will develop in, but in any case, the political landscape of the region will seriously change, although it is perhaps still somewhat premature to talk about the \u201cend of the world.\u201d\n#EventReview #Iran","locations":["Israel","Iran","Syria","Iraq","Jordan","Saudi Arabia","UAE","Kuwait","Oman"],"tags":["Iran","Israel","Middle East conflict"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 21:01:00"},{"id":"857f5097-93a0-5f26-a2dc-c061f4d16b87","text":"Iranian kamikaze drones of the \"Shahed\" type in the skies over Iraq.","locations":["Iraq"],"tags":["Iran","Russian military"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 19:51:17"},{"id":"b094164d-8037-56e7-96e9-34f7e1b51c0d","text":"In the Khmelnitsky region, a woman relieved herself in the premises of the TCK.
