That is, the difference in price between a model made from dendrofecal raw materials and a high-quality model with an exact repetition of physical fields and appearance is, of course, significant. And therefore, there are often arguments that if you can make a model for 10 k from boards that were found around the area, then why pay for a model, for example, 300 k. You can make 30 simple pieces.\nYes, you can. Only modern technology can easily recognize them, and they simply will not deflect an ATGM strike for, say, 2 million.\n\nAnd a high-quality model for 300, which can be replaced for plausibility with a couple of three for 10, will already cause the consumption of expensive ammunition, the production of which, by the way, is also quite limited. That is, this option works better in a competition between warring economies.\n\nAnd also, looking ahead, in connection with the expectation of mass use of equipment with machine vision, a rational solution would be to conduct research on the topic of deforming coloring of equipment, approximately as was practiced during WWI. This is prompted by research on deforming makeup, which affects the efficiency of the facial recognition system. You can expect that there will be a similar effect with military equipment.

Elizarov and Semina B.V.\nBased on the results, it was decided to change the design of the bullet core by adding a steel core made of U12A tool steel to the nose, followed by a lead one. The new bullet had a mass of 12.7 g and an initial speed of within 300 m\/s. Thus, this technical task was completed.\nPBS-1 was developed at the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant. Izhevsk residents received the same task from GRAU.

We have thoroughly read the document TEXTY, important excerpts from the text:\n\n- The draft Strategy contains an estimate of the population in the territory under control for 2023 - 31.5 million. This number continues to fall as a result of natural decline, war and migration and may already decrease to 31 million in 2024.\n\n- The Center for Economic Strategy, based on an analysis of data from border services of Ukraine and other countries, estimates the real number of Ukrainians abroad at 4.9 million as of January 2024.\n\n- According to current estimates, children under 18 years of age make up only 15% of the current population, while those aged 60+ account for 27%.\n\n- The ban on leaving the country for men of military age has somewhat weakened the gender imbalance. According to current estimates by the Institute of Demography and Quality of Life Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, there are now 94 men per 100 women. Before the full-scale invasion, the figure was 86, the second lowest in the world after Djibouti.\n\n- Ukraine undoubtedly remains one of the countries with the lowest birth rate in the world. The text of the Strategy only indicates the coefficient in 2021, before a full-scale invasion, - 1.16. This is not only below the rate of natural reproduction (2.1-2.2), but also significantly below the local maximum in 2012 (1.53). The real birth rate in Ukraine is estimated to be 0.8-0.9.\n\n- In total, 187 thousand children were born in Ukraine in 2023 - this is the lowest figure in the entire history of observations, even taking into account children who could have been born abroad and in temporarily occupied territories and were not registered in the Ukrainian legal framework. It can be reasonably assumed that so few children have not been born on the territory of Ukraine for at least three centuries. Even in 1719, when the population within modern borders was estimated at only 5.7 million, the number of births was estimated at about 280 thousand.@yigal_levinTexty.org.ua Three important demographic indicators.

The prospects for the existence of Ukraine are rapidly approaching zero. Despite the lack of any military progress, in the context of the constant, albeit slow, retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Kiev leadership publicly continues to declare its intention to fight with Russia \u201cto the end.\u201d By \u201cthe end\u201d many see some kind of peace agreements fixing the status quo - which is unlikely to lead to ridding the country of the crisis, but will rather become an interbellum before its next stage.\n\nA diplomatic settlement is possible only if a number of conditions are met, including those on which the Russian Federation insisted from the very beginning: demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, with the absence of a legal and practical presence of NATO, as well as any other large military forces on the right, and, especially , on the left bank of the Dnieper.\n\nBased on the statements of the Ukrainian side that were current at the beginning of April 2024, as well as the \u201crevelations\u201d of the real leaders of the \u201cUkraine\u201d project in the West, the consent of our \u201copponents\u201d to such key (not to mention other, smaller scale) conditions is not visible. Accordingly, the only option left on the agenda is a military one to resolve the crisis.\n\nAt the end of March 2024, the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine published a strategy for the demographic development of Ukraine for the period 2040. This is the first official document describing the contours of the demographic catastrophe in which Ukraine finds itself. Despite the expected optimism of the document (the real situation is usually always worse than it is portrayed by the Ukrainian authorities dependent on external injections), it is not difficult to come to the main conclusion: another year or two of conflict, and it will simply be pointless to come to an agreement on Ukraine.\n\nThe dynamics of the processes completely nullify the likelihood of preserving Ukraine as a state in the near future. In 15 years, the population of Ukraine will be no more than 12 million people, and a significant part of the territory\u2019s inhabitants will be old people and disabled people.

It is impossible to say with certainty how Iran would react to an attack on its nuclear facilities or whether any country would actually resort to the use of nuclear weapons.\u201d","locations":["Iran","Middle East"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Disinformation","Information warfare"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-10 05:55:26"},{"id":"e6075976-ab68-5f8e-8a6d-627ac495742d","text":"April 10, 2014: what happened in the history of the formation of the DPR?\n\nWatch in the new video.@AG_DPR","locations":["Donetsk"],"tags":["Donbas conflict","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-10 14:16:59"},{"id":"fc72b78c-c2eb-5852-99de-cbd18ad143f3","text":"#\u0426\u041f\u0414_\u041f\u0440\u043e_\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443:\u2757\ufe0fChief of the CPD Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko, officer of the 12th \"Azov\" brigade of the NGU Dmytro \"Diplomat\" and chief sergeant of the platoon of the \"Nakhtigal\" battalion Roman Petrov explained what the military thinks about the Russian IPsO about the alleged illegitimacy of the Ukrainian government.\u25b6\ufe0fhttps:\/ \/youtu.be\/eV5x721uHVITGFBINSTYTTWTTWA","locations":[""],"tags":["Ukrainian nationalism","Information warfare","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-10 16:33:07"},{"id":"2c1d1dd3-6e0b-544a-90c3-30b056f875b4","text":"On April 10, 1716, Peter I approved the \u201cLand Military Charter\u201d - a military-legal document that formalized the creation of a regular army in Russia and determined the order of its life and activities.\n\nThe Military Regulations of Peter I consisted of three parts. The first reflected the structure of the organization of troops. The charter provided for the formation of a light corps (\u201ccorvolant\u201d), as well as a reserve corps. Special chapters were devoted to the general (field) headquarters, quartermaster service, field service, camp organization, guards, inspections, organization of field hospitals, mail, etc. The rights and responsibilities of senior military ranks were specifically outlined.\n\nThe second part of the Charter was called \u201cMilitary Article\u201d and contained information about the norms of state and criminal law, the structure of military courts and the procedure for considering cases in them, as well as provisions relating to military discipline and internal service. The charter introduced the military oath and determined the procedure for its adoption.\n\nThe third part of the Charter - \u201cOn Exercising\u201d - was devoted to combat service, military training and education, the rights and responsibilities of regimental ranks. Particular attention was paid to developing initiative among officers and soldiers in battle, instilling in them high patriotic feelings, military honor, and courage.\n\nThe \u201cland military charter\u201d of 1716, in terms of the richness of its content, significantly exceeded all the charters of Western European armies and had a noticeable influence on the development of Russian criminal law. Its provisions remained in effect without any significant changes until the end of the 19th century.","locations":["Russia"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-10 01:57:17"},{"id":"804d0275-0f84-5c8d-b656-3d314967fae4","text":"\ud83d\udca5In Crimea, the Russian Ka-27 naval multi-purpose helicopter was destroyed \ud83d\udcf2Subscribe to Ukrinform|Facebook|Twitter|YouTube","locations":["Crimea"],"tags":["Russian military intervention"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-10 07:00:08"},{"id":"a9eb59fd-dc81-5b24-91d2-ed0a3981b465","text":"\u201cVETERANS OF RUSSIA\u201d: CONGRATULATIONS TO MUSLIMS ON THE HOLIDAY OF EID-AL-FITR \u2013 URAZA BAYRAM The all-Russian public movement \u201cVeterans of Russia\u201d warmly and cordially congratulates all Muslims on the great holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which is celebrated with special admiration and respect by all followers of Islam around the world . This bright day marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a time filled with abstinence, prayer and the pursuit of spiritual perfection. This year, the fasting period was tested by a serious tragedy that occurred in Krasnogorsk, affecting both Muslims and Christians, which became a real test of strength our unity. During these dark days, the forces of evil tried to undermine our mutual understanding and mutual respect, but they were defeated. Our unity, formed over centuries of common history and joint struggle for common values, remains unshakable. Today, after a period of fasting, comes the time of celebrating Eid al-Adha, a time of joy, generosity and love for one's neighbor. Your feelings and desires for unity are close to all of us, regardless of our faith, because our ideals are consonant: love for family, compassion for those in need, devotion to the Fatherland. We congratulate you and your loved ones on this great holiday, as well as all Muslims of our country and fraternal peoples around the world, all Muslim warriors participating in a special military operation.

The airfield, located on French territory in the islands of the southern Caribbean, has one runway 12\/30 with a length of 3129 meters.\n\nThe crew of the Air France Airbus A320 requested a visual approach to Runway 12, received permission and began to carry it out. Weather conditions at that time: Report No. 1: Wind 130 degrees 6 with gusts up to 13 knots (direction varies from 100 to 160 degrees), NGO (cloud base) scattered - 1500 feet, significant - 2200 feet.\n\nReport No. 2 (after 30 minutes): Wind 130 degrees 4 knots, minor low wind - 1800 feet, solid low low - 8000 feet. The plane's recorders recorded wind with a direction of 100 degrees and a speed of 25 knots at an altitude of 2000 feet. The equipment measuring NGO is installed at Runway 30, so the readings on Runway 12 may not be completely accurate. The pilot was piloted by the commander, the co-pilot controlled. Having reached an altitude of 2000 feet, the crew began to release the mechanization and landing gear; the autopilot and autothrottle were disabled. The plane performing the \u201cbox\u201d began to take a landing course, but the crew lost visual contact with the runway. At that moment the plane was at an altitude of 1430 feet with a bank of 28 degrees. The controller, who cleared landing on runway 12, had the MSAW (minimum safe altitude warning) system activated, which he informed the pilots about, but they took it into account only the second time. The plane was 1 nautical mile south of the runway center line at distance 2 .5 nautical miles from the runway, and the crew decided to go around. The re-approach was carried out using the ILS system. The investigation revealed that the crew\u2019s decision to perform a visual approach at night was justified:\n\n\u2013 the desire to maintain your flying skills, shorten the trajectory and gain time;\n\u2013 experience in performing such an approach at this airport.\n\nThe crew did not carefully study the weather reports, and by turning off the autothrottle, they created an additional burden for themselves.

But the race still took place, and Cambridge University won both the men's and women's regatta.\nAfterwards, Leonard Jenkins of Oxford University told the BBC that on his team, \"a couple of guys got really sick with E. coli, I was vomiting this morning, I wasn't sure I'd have a chance of making the team.\" He added: \"It would be a lot better if there wasn't so much poop in the water.\"\nAgainst the backdrop of the already real environmental catastrophe of British rivers, record sewage discharges last year exploded public opinion in the United Kingdom and prompted officials responsible for environmental monitoring to at least somehow respond to the situation.\nSo, the EA said that from next year utility providers in England and Wales will be required to install monitors on an additional seven thousand emergency overflow pipes that have not yet been taken into account.\nThese pipes are different from normal sewage overflow pipes, which are only designed to discharge wastewater during heavy rainfall to prevent the risk of flooding.\nEmergency overflow pipes only operate under emergency circumstances such as mechanical failures such as power failures and outages, situations beyond the control of water companies.\nHelen Wakeham, director of water at the EA, said: \u201cWe want full transparency about the discharge of wastewater into our water environment. As we change the way we regulate the industry, this high level of transparency is critical. This lifts the lid on how our networks operate and drives improvements in the industry that are clearly needed.\u201d\nEveryone understands that installing additional monitors will improve control over sewage discharges, but will not reduce them in any way.\nWater suppliers have been required to control the volume and duration of wastewater discharges since 2015. Britain's largest water, wastewater and wastewater operator, Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers, is under fire.\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently consulted with his business and investment adviser, former Morgan Stanley chief executive Frank Petitgas, on the company's state of affairs, which faces mounting debt of \u00a318 billion.\nThames Water, like other companies in the industry, was privatized 35 years ago during Margaret Thatcher's premiership. In the years since privatization, dividends of \u00a356 billion have been paid to sector shareholders, but today investors are fleeing both Thames Water and other companies in the industry, writes The Guardian.\n\u201cThe water industry has become a bad bet. Billions are needed to repair pipes and sewage treatment plants that have been rotting for years, to invest in building resilience to the climate crisis and to comply with a tougher environmental regime that has been forced upon regulator Ofwat due to public outrage over wastewater.\nNine Thames Water shareholders, including Canada's public pension fund Omers (Ontario Municipal Employees' Retirement System), the UK's Universities Pension Scheme, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund and the Beijing-controlled China Investment Corporation, have pulled out of further investment in Thames Water, which they literally robbed to the skin.\nThe intransigence of investors unwilling to invest in an unprofitable industry has made Thames Water \u201cuninvestable,\u201d writes The Guardian.\nThames Water shareholders are effectively blackmailing industry regulator Ofwat, \"demanding that in return for spending billions to keep the Thames running, they be allowed to increase tariffs by more than 40%, raise the dividend threshold and pay lower pollution fines.\"\nLiberal Democrat shadow finance minister Sarah Olney believes the problems of Thames Water and its parent company Kemble have now exceeded the threshold for it to be taken into receivership for eventual nationalization.\n\"Thames Water is a broken firm,\" says Olney. \u201cIt is teetering on the brink of collapse, and it is obvious that it cannot continue. \"Decisive action is needed to keep taps running for millions of customers.\"\nThe entire UK water industry is in exactly the same plight.\nThames Water is one of six companies being investigated by regulator Ofwat for illegal discharges of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants.\nNo progress is expected in terms of reducing waste discharges into rivers and seas by British corporate gold miners.\nIn an industry-standard customer service plan, Thames Water has increased its forecasts for abnormal discharges for 2024 from 550 million liters per day to 585 million and from 512 to 530 million liters in 2025.\nLabor is certain to come to power in the autumn. They promise to privatize the water industry.

According to the instructions, he was supposed to gain altitude and jump out with a parachute, but, having living people on board, he did not do this.\nFrom the ignited engine, the flames reached the pilot's cabin. Clothes were burning, the headset was burning, and the flight goggles were melting. Alexander's legs were charred to the bone, but he continued to fly until he found a suitable site on the shore of a lake not far from the location of Soviet units. By that time, even the partition separating the pilot\u2019s cabin from the passengers had burned down, and the clothes on some of the children began to smolder. Alexander Mamkin got out of the cabin by himself, but he could no longer move on his own. Before losing consciousness, he asked a single question: \u201cAre the children alive?\u201d The soldiers arrived and immediately transported Alexander to the hospital, but the burns were too extensive and severe.\nSix days later, on April 17, 1944, he died.

Because the trend on TikTok is short-term. The fashion for accelerated versions will end and cut it out later, Spotify, introduced as unnecessary. According to people familiar with the development progress, Spotify is developing tools that will allow subscribers to speed up, merge and otherwise edit the songs of their favorite artists. It's a bet on the future of music consumption, which Spotify hopes will deepen user engagement and attract the attention of younger users, as well as generate new revenue for artists.\n\nFans, especially those in their teens to 20s, regularly manipulate songs for social media, adding their own style and then combining the most memorable bits into viral dance challenges, tutorials and memes. But artists and labels don't often get paid for altered versions of their songs, which are difficult to track and often spread across platforms including TikTok and Instagram Reels.\n\nCopyright holders \u2014 labels, publishers and artists \u2014 will be compensated when fans stream modified versions of their music on Spotify, the people said.\n\nAccording to the plans Spotify is discussing, the new tools could function as a sort of playback feature, with users deciding at what speed they want to listen to a song, for example.

The delegates got acquainted in detail with the work of specialized educational institutions, toured a number of production facilities and research centers. Several national companies are involved in subsoil use in the country, but the basis of the industry is made up of transnational corporations that mine gold, platinum, nickel, chromium, and lithium.\n\nThis is the reason why the continent cannot get out of poverty - the main rent from the exploitation of its national wealth, which lies in the depths, is extracted by complete strangers who are not interested in the well-being of local residents.\ud83d\udcac\u201cForeign investors can have 100% ownership rights for deposits of any types of mineral raw materials, except platinum and diamonds. To extract the latter, foreigners must create a joint venture with the government of the country with shares of 51% to 49%. As for deposits of other resources, they operate on the basis of concession agreements, that is, in fact, they are leased from Western companies. The tenant is not obliged to report to the Federal Government either about the actual production volumes or about his income; he only pays relatively small fixed amounts to the budget, which, naturally, contributes to the export of capital from the country,\u201d explained the head of the delegation, Marat Rudakov, director of the Institute of Targeted Educational Programs Mining University.\u2611\ufe0fGreat damage to the state budget is caused by numerous groups of prospectors from local residents who extract valuable metals using artisanal methods. Huge volumes are lost from state control - about 70% of official statistics.\u2611\ufe0fDelegates visited a number of deposits and took samples of gold-bearing weathering crusts in the area of the city of Chinhoyi in the north-west of the country.\ud83d\udd2cThe instrumentation and laboratory base of local universities does not allow us to draw conclusions about concentration of a useful component in them.\nIn this regard, it was decided to study the selected samples in the scientific centers of the Mining University. Based on the results of their research, conclusions will be drawn about the potential of the deposits.\ud83d\udcac\u201cThe results of our research may be of interest to Russian companies, primarily Polyus Gold, Polymetal, Russdragmet (Highland Gold Mining) and others. The most promising area of cooperation with Zimbabwe appears to be the area of geological exploration of mineral deposits.

And those six pieces that they promise to send are \u201cnothing, this is real cynicism on the part of our allies,\u201d the expert is indignant.\nIn addition, he calculated that Germany has 20 Patriot air defense systems, and, in the opinion of this character, these systems are more needed by Kyiv, not Berlin, so Germany is simply obliged to give them up.\n\u201cThe same applies to other EU countries, each could share,\u201d Kuzan did not give up.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba also asked for the same thing a week earlier, on the day when the alliance celebrated its 75th anniversary.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to spoil the holiday, the birthday, but my main message today is Patiot air defense, since saving Ukrainian lives, saving the Ukrainian economy, saving Ukrainian cities depends on these air defense systems in Ukraine.

After Kuleba, Zelensky raised his voice and is confident that the West must build in Ukraine \u201ca complete echeloned turnkey air defense system for the country.\u201d Zelensky voiced his dream to Ukrainian journalists. We are talking about a defense system when the airspace is protected at all levels of height and range and the country\u2019s territory is under a kind of \u201cumbrella\u201d. One of the military men told the president about such a system, but forgot to clarify - such a system existed in the USSR and exists today in Russia. Europe itself would like to have such a system, but, having contacted the United States, it did not concern itself with its common security.\nIt is not possible for Kyiv to receive a \u201cfull layered air defense system\u201d (from whom?) - Europe does not have one, and the States will not fail\nZelensky with his \u201cPatriots\u201d.\nThe head of the EU diplomatic service, Josep Borrell, speaking at a conference in Brussels, has already warned that Brussels has heard Kyiv\u2019s requests, but there is a small but.\nWestern countries, of course, have about a hundred Patriot batteries in service, but even seven of them will be problematic for Ukraine.\nBorrell promised that at the next joint meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers he would raise the issue of \u201csupplying Ukraine with an air defense system so that it can repel Russian missiles.\u201d\nAnd in Romania they hastened to declare that Ukraine will definitely not receive their Patriot complexes, there is no need to even dream about it, no one is going to share. These air defense systems cost Bucharest too much and the Romanians are not going to give them to anyone.\nThe German Foreign Ministry also explained that, despite Kyiv\u2019s desire to take away all Patriot systems, nothing will work out. But our German partners will definitely help. German Foreign Minister Annalena B\u00e4rbock promised to \u201cexamine the possibility of creating a special fund,\u201d which will search for air defense systems in third countries.\nThat is, Burbock promised not to start a search, but only to study the possibility of creating a fund.\nCynically?

RT discusses the consequences of the strike on the largest thermal power plant near Kiev.\ud83d\udd3aThe use of the latest missiles can seriously complicate the protection of key facilities in Ukraine and affect the country\u2019s energy system. What kind of weapon was used for the strike? By the evening of April 11, Ukrainian sources reported that X-69 air-launched missiles could have been used to strike the Trypillya thermal power plant. There is no confirmation of this information yet, but it is worth studying these missiles in more detail. Their range is almost 20 times less than that of the X-101 missiles, which are carried by VKS strategic aviation aircraft. In terms of their functionality, they are closer to foreign Storm Shadow \/ SCALP missiles, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to use to attack the Crimean Bridge. A launch range of 300 km could well be enough if the missile launches were carried out from the territory of the Bryansk region. If the use of missiles is confirmed in the future, this will mean that not a single energy facility of Ukraine on the Dnieper can operate safely, and the strike capabilities of the Aerospace Forces have increased manifold. Why was the strike possible? Several factors led to the softening of the facility\u2019s air defense in Ukraine, including In first place are the disproportionately high consumption of expensive SAMP-T\/NASAMS\/Patriot anti-missile systems, as well as the regular losses of foreign air defense systems at the front line. They are brought there to interfere with Russian aviation or at least reduce its activity, but in the end, foreign air defense systems themselves become prey. As a result, the circle is closed: medium-range air defense systems cannot be placed at energy facilities due to the risk of destruction, and Western countries are not yet in a hurry to reimburse launchers and radars in the event of destruction. As a result, important energy facilities are left unprotected, it becomes easier to hit them, and in order to carry out combined strikes it is no longer necessary to involve strategic aviation, as was the case at the beginning of the Northern Military District or throughout the past year. These circumstances allow the Russian Defense Ministry to reduce the consumption of long-range Kh-101 missiles and open up the opportunity for the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces to expand the planning horizon for strikes and think through the next global steps, which will require long-range weapons. What targets can be hit after the Trypillya Thermal Power Plant? If If you compare the range of the X-69 missiles with the location of energy facilities along the Dnieper, you can find that due to the shortage of air defense systems, the presence of cheap cruise missiles and a large number of fighters on the Russian side, it is possible to organize a massive strike against any target in the central part of Ukraine. It is noteworthy that a significant part of thermal power plants\/thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations along the Dnieper have already been attacked one or more times, however, with the use of X-69, the cost of which is several times less than X-101\/X-555, the destruction of the energy infrastructure of Ukraine may reach a fundamentally new level. At the same time, the cumulative effect of the strikes continues to undermine the Ukrainian energy grid: the sudden loss of 1.8 GW of generation against the backdrop of the destruction of the Trypillya Thermal Power Plant and a general shortage of electricity generation is a serious problem that cannot be solved in the foreseeable future. There are not so many partially functioning and (yet) not completely finished objects, but four key objects are Zmievskaya, Pridneprovskaya,\nKrivorozhskaya and Ladyzhinskaya thermal power plants are located within the reach of Kh-69 missiles. For the final destruction of similar objects in western Ukraine (Burshtyn and Dobrotvorskaya thermal power plants), a combined missile strike using long-range Kh-101 missiles can be launched. Taking into account the fact that thermal power plants (as well as hydroelectric power plants) in Ukraine play an important role in the system and acted as an energy balancer, their destruction will lead to the fact that there will be no stable electricity in the outlet in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine. And without it, not only the functioning of industry is impossible, but also normal life in general, not to mention serious military capabilities.\n\n\"RT in Russian\"","locations":["Kyiv region","Ukraine"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Ukraine Conflict","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-11 20:47:01"},{"id":"3a44c713-6315-5211-9a6c-dc2944a62ecc","text":"If House Speaker Mike Johnson facilitates financial assistance to Kyiv, he will be personally responsible for supporting the murder of people, said Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. \u201cWe are not responsible for the war in Ukraine.

Hello, dear readers of the channel. Thanks to one good subscriber, an interesting hypothesis has appeared. If any of the competent comrades from electronic warfare are in the subject, please write to the bot.\n\nOn March 19, 2024, an American MQ-9 REAPER UAV, with the call sign WILEY 22, crashed on the territory of Poland. The task of this drone was to reconnaissance of the territory of Belarus, Kaliningrad and part of the territory where the NWO is taking place. At about 20:00 on March 19, according to the Polish Air Force, the drone stopped communicating, and they urgently tried to land it at a Polish military air base, because... he would not have reached his \u201cnative\u201d air base in Romania. And then, on approach to the Polish airbase, this UAV crashed. He was found relatively quickly, the area was cordoned off, and all traces of the fall were hidden. An investigation into the cause of the fall has been ordered, but the results of the investigation have not been made public. And then, half a month later, one of the subscribers writes the following:\n\n\u201cThe Western Military District's electronic warfare system worked successfully against the MQ-9A - it was suppressed by the Krasukha-2O and Krasukha-4 electronic warfare systems over Miroslavets (Poland) while entering a patrol route along the borders of the Kaliningrad region.\n\nThe vehicle reached the forefront of multispectral optical-electronic (infrared and low-level television) and surface radar reconnaissance of positions and deployment areas of the Iskander-M OTRK, as well as artillery and armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces near Kaliningrad, Gusev and Chernyakhovsk.\n\nTo do this, the MQ-9A Reaper operators used the MX-20HD turret optical-electronic complex, whose medium- and long-wave IR channels were supposed to ensure detection of our heat-contrast equipment and personnel in the IR range, as well as AN\/APY-8 AFAR radar in synthetic aperture (SAR) modes and detection of moving equipment in GMTI mode (with its classification).\n\nAs a result, the APY-8 radar operating in the X-band, the SATCOM satellite data exchange channel antenna and the C-band communication and data exchange antenna were exposed to the narrow interference beam of the C\/X-band of the Krasukha-4 complex.\n\nThe Krasukha-2O L\/S-band electronic warfare system suppressed GPS navigation modules, as well as the Iridium-Data Link antenna aperture distributed over the airframe.\n\nUPD: The vehicle was forced to return to the deployment base using the INS, autopilot and backup command and telemetry channels with a descent and \u201cthrow\u201d behind the radio horizon screen from the Krasukha-2O and Krasukha-4 complexes. #UAVTelegramScience of winningProject for those who want to study military affairs and competently apply the acquired knowledge.\n\nIf you have useful information or interesting materials and ...VIEW CHANNEL","locations":["Belarus","Kaliningrad region","Poland"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Electronic warfare","UAVs"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-11 08:02:15"},{"id":"5f1763c7-aae8-5182-bd77-3395c367bf3a","text":"The Ka-52 continues to plague enemy equipment in the Kharkov direction!\ud83d\udc4a","locations":["Kharkov direction"],"tags":["Russian aviation","Russian military intervention","Ka-52"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-11 11:22:52"},{"id":"fbc0c0ef-d399-55fd-8a17-d4a6b57e98c2","text":"An oil production plant was launched in Khujand.

The main one is security issues.\n\n10 years ago, the situation in the region began to rapidly deteriorate. In the Sahel region, located between northern and western Africa, radical Islamist groups have become more active and have captured large areas. The authorities of African countries control them purely nominally, including Nigeria, which is supposed to supply gas to Europe, and Niger, through which the gas pipeline will pass to Algeria.\n\nThere are a number of terrorist groups operating there, the fight against which has been going on for many years with varying success. The most dangerous of them are Boko Haram and the Islamic State, banned in Russia.\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7Previously, the Sahel region was under the French, but as a result of the events of the last two years, Paris actually lost them. Regimes loyal to him in a number of countries were overthrown, and the French troops were shown the door by the new authorities.\nOne of the reasons for acute dissatisfaction with the French was precisely their inability to protect African countries from radical Islamists. Now Russia has taken the place of the French.\ud83d\udcac \u201cThe region in the Sahel is still torn apart by acute contradictions, inter-tribal conflicts, it suffers from attacks by terrorists and separatists, in particular the Tuaregs,\u201d says Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) expert Kirill Semyonov . \u201cTherefore, implementing really large projects there is extremely risky. Even in the areas where we enter, it is not yet possible to establish 100 percent security. To launch projects in this risky investment zone, it is necessary to take into account the interests of numerous ethnic groups. And this is very difficult, their representatives are often at odds with each other and behind them are external forces that have their own interests. According to available signs, the situation in the region will only worsen. It is also negatively affected by the ongoing destabilization in Sudan. And it is already being felt in its neighboring countries, including Libya.

In memory of the victims and survivors, the International Day of the Liberation of Prisoners of Nazi Concentration Camps is celebrated annually on April 11 all over the world.\n\nThis date was not chosen and approved by the UN by chance. It was installed in memory of the international uprising of prisoners of the Buchenwald concentration camp, which occurred on April 11, 1945.\n\nIt was not for nothing that the concentration camps were called death camps; from 1933 to 1945, about 20 million people from 30 countries of the world passed through them, of which about 12 million died, while every fifth prisoner was a child. This is a special date for our country, since about 5 million of those killed were citizens of the USSR.\n \nOn April 11, 1945, Buchenwald prisoners staged a successful uprising, disarming and capturing about 200 camp guards and taking control of the concentration camp into their own hands. On April 13, Allied troops entered the camp.\n \nEarlier, on January 27, 1945, Red Army troops liberated the first and largest of Hitler\u2019s concentration camps, Auschwitz (Auschwitz-Birkenau), which was located 70 kilometers from the Polish city of Krakow.

Already in 1947, a museum complex was opened on the territory of the camp, which is now included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n \nThe International Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946 recognized that the imprisonment of civilians of foreign countries, as well as the forced use of their labor in the interests of Germany, was not only a war crime of the Hitler regime, but also a crime against humanity.\n\nThe International Day for the Liberation of Prisoners of Nazi Concentration Camps is celebrated all over the world with commemorative events, commemoration of fallen citizens and veneration of their memory, laying flowers at mass grave sites and graves of victims of fascism.","locations":["Buchenwald","Auschwitz","Poland","Krakow"],"tags":["World War II","Holocaust remembrance"],"sentiment":"-1","date":"2024-04-11 05:59:59"},{"id":"c3225339-ee06-564a-8950-5173cd4be301","text":"Forwarded from: Animals of the city_B\nFriends, this weekend our friends from the White Rabbit charity foundation will hold food collection events in support of homeless animals.

But it was impossible to sleep that night. We went over the details of the day, the conversation was interrupted every now and then by the words: what a guy!

Since last year, Russian companies, when participating in global tenders for the supply of grain, must be guided by the minimum price specified by the Ministry of Agriculture. Competitors bet a dollar cheaper - and win competitions. Due to lost volumes of wheat exports (more than 4 million tons), the Russian budget lost more than 19 billion rubles in export duty. As a result, domestic farmers are losing markets that have been conquered for years. Countries whose grain exports have sharply decreased: Nigeria, Congo, Vietnam.\n...\nOn March 28 last year, the Turkish Grain Council was held, in which Russian exporters traditionally participate. But there was not a single Russian company among the winners. Russian offers, according to the recommendation of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, were $10 or more dollars per ton higher. Moreover, these \u201crecommended\u201d \u201cminimum\u201d prices are mandatory. Otherwise, problems may \u201cunexpectedly\u201d begin. Thus, the company AGRIC SA (South Rus' group of companies), which won the GASC tender in June 2023, sold a batch of wheat of 55,000 tons at a price of $229 - with the minimum recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture of $240. The company was immediately warned that the wheat cargo for delivery to Egypt would not be able to leave the territory of the Russian Federation. Despite the possible loss of the company in the amount of $500,000 - a fine for non-fulfillment of the contract to GASC. As a result, the exporter had to change the origin of the grain from Russian to Romanian. The next company was Demeter. She offered GASC 480,000 tons of grade 4 wheat at a price about $20 below the minimum recommended. As a result, 4 Demeter vessels with grain were unable to leave due to \u201csuddenly\u201d problems with obtaining phytosanitary certificates for the cargo.\n...\nThe reason for all this is simple. The higher the export price set by the agricultural department, the higher the export duty, which goes to the Ministry of Agriculture. Currently, the duty is calculated based on the price recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture - $235 FOB. And the market \u201cred\u201d price is $195. The market, as we know, does not tolerate a vacuum. If Russia doesn\u2019t sell its grain, supplies will come from Ukraine. https:\/\/www.mk.ru\/economics\/2024\/04\/09\/rastenievody-poprosili-otpustit-eksportnye-ceny-izza-poteri-vyruchki.htmlwww.mk.ruGrowers asked to release export prices due to loss of revenue.

Lavrov during a meeting with representatives of relevant parliamentary committees on international affairs of the BRICS countries (Moscow, April 11, 2024) Main points:\n\n\u2022 Today the world is truly at a turning point, a milestone in its development. This is due to the ongoing process of formation of a multipolar world order. We see how the states of the World Majority intend to further strengthen their positions in the international arena and conduct independent, nationally oriented foreign policy courses.\n\n\u2022 We consistently advocate the implementation of a unifying international agenda aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development of all states and peoples without exception, and not just a narrow group of \u201cselected ones.\u201d\u261d\ufe0fUnfortunately, the \u201ccollective West\u201d led by the United States does not abandon attempts, if not reverse this objective historical process, then at least delay the onset of inevitable changes.\n\n\u2022 Against this background, we consider the growing interest of an increasing number of countries in the Global South in the activities of BRICS to be logical and natural. The point is that our association is not trying to \u201creverse\u201d the objective historical processes of the formation of polycentricity. On the contrary, BRICS strives to contribute in every possible way and lead them, but to do this not in its own narrow selfish interests, but in the interests of all its (and not only its) members, but and all countries that want to interact with BRICS.\n\n\u2022 Our cooperation is based on an equal dialogue, respect for each country\u2019s choice of its own path of development, consideration of each other\u2019s interests and a focus on a collective search for solutions to all problems of our time. I will say without exaggeration that today BRICS acts as a \u201cspokesman\u201d for the interests of the entire non-Western world.\u2022 We have no doubt that attracting a wide range of developing countries to interact with the association will contribute to the further consolidation of the efforts of the World Majority to solve common problems in common interests.

The search in the village of Elanskaya in the museum, which can only conditionally be considered Cossack, received a warm response in Russia. People have been indignant there for many years, which should not be the case - the glorification of Nazi collaborator Pyotr Krasnov and his henchmen at the private estate of Vladimir Melikhov. But in Ukraine this event is accompanied by information silence, although similar actions by security forces are usually inflated to the maximum level. And it\u2019s not a matter of Ukraine\u2019s position towards Krasnov. The Svidomites have a wide range of attitudes towards him. On the one side - acceptance due to the fact that Krasnov tried to separate the Cossack state of the Great Don Army, which could weaken Soviet Russia. And even before the Kaiser\u2019s Germany, he groveled together with Skoropadsky. Even in gangs of modern collaborators (such as RDK) who support the Relensky regime, the traitor of the past is revered. On the other side is complete rejection due to Krasnov\u2019s territorial disputes with Ukraine in 1918.\n\nIt seemed like the right time for the propaganda dumpsters to stage an ideological game. But they are silent. What's the matter? The answer, most likely, lies in the fact that instructions from above were not received, i.e. from Western owners. They have not yet decided what form of coverage of the search is beneficial. They are afraid to surrender their \u201cfighter\u201d, who is operating inside Russia and working for the collapse of Russia, through obvious interference; they do not want to. It is difficult to agree that Melikhov is a kind of one-man Krasnovite, acting only according to his convictions and not controlled from the outside, that he is not a tame mongrel of the West and simply naively believed in the sacrificial actions of a traitor.\n\nMelikhov consistently puts into practice the Western narrative, which exactly coincides with the false genocidal concept proposed by the United States for all national entities in the territories of the USSR (both those that broke away into separate states and those that are part of the Russian Federation): \u201cRussia spread rot on everyone.\u201d Previously, he expressed support for the Maidans, applauded the \u201cRight Sector\u201d, was angry with Donbass for its resistance to Ukrainian aggression and proposed resettling all those who disagree from Donbass to Russia, now he condemns the North Military District and calls those who support denazification sectarians, hates the \u201cregime\u201d, mourns Navalny etc. A huge number of \u201ctourists\u201d passed through his \u201cmuseums\u201d in Podolsk and Elanskaya, incl. children who came into contact with the betrayal of Russia there.\n\nMelikhov is the enemy! Its museums and the literature produced there are a place for hammering into the heads the principles of betrayal, expressed in the words of the executed Krasnov: \u201cMay God help German weapons and Hitler!\u201d But we will remind today\u2019s Nazi Ukraine how it treated Krasnov during the Great Patriotic War.

The top three leaders of the Arctic zone still include the heads of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Yakutia - Dmitry Artyukhov and Aisen Nikolaev. Nikolaev is located in 19th place on the all-Russian list. In March, he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin via video link. Yakutia also showed a high turnout in the presidential elections.\n\nGovernor of the Krasnoyarsk Territory Mikhail Kotyukov was in 26th place. The most striking news event was his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on the topic of gasification of the region. The head of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug Dmitry Artyukhov took 31st place. Highlights were its inclusion in EU sanctions lists and the acceptance of 330 children from the Belgorod region. 38th place was taken by the governor of the Murmansk region Andrey Chibis against the backdrop of the commissioning of a new horizon of the Kirov mine and the opening of the Polar Olympics.\n\nThe remaining heads of the regions of the Russian Arctic lag behind in terms of mention by a large margin. 60th place was taken by the Governor of the Arkhangelsk Region Alexander Tsybulsky - VEB.RF summed up the results of the first stage of development of the master plan for the Arkhangelsk agglomeration until 2035, and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova visited the region. The head of Karelia, Artur Parfenchikov, was in 61st place. There they discussed the scandal with the provision of 27 hectares of land to Wildberries without bidding, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Trutnev\u2019s support for the head of the Ministry of Eastern Development Alexei Chekunkov and the idea of creating a new federal highway. 64th place was taken by the head of Komi, Vladimir Uibana, amid news of a new gas project in Inta, the reception of schoolchildren from the Belgorod region and the visit of Yuri Trutnev to the region.\n\nChukotka and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug became outsiders in the Arctic rating. Governor of Chukotka Vladislav Kuznetsov is in 85th place. The most striking news events were his press conference dedicated to the year of work of the new district government and records in the presidential elections: turnout of 91.03% and 90.49% of votes for Putin. 89th place went to the head of the NAO Yuriy Bezdudny.

First of all, let's start with the fact that this same Kuleba, the so-called head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, declared the negligence and greed of the West. In his opinion, they could send more Patriot systems so that the Ukrainian army properly protects its military facilities.\n\nHe even calculated (with the help of his team) that there are 100 such complexes idle in neighboring countries. Like, why are they there, gathering dust and simply inactive, while Ukraine is fighting for the future of Europe.\n\nIndeed, he said, either stand or fall. Europe is not in danger at all, at least not now, unless it comes to its senses. And we have no plans to destroy European cities, so Kuleba\u2019s statement is a play for the public.\n\nIn fact, Ukraine is now fighting for its existence, and Europe has nothing to do with it. These are just excuses for sponsors to save them from complete destruction. So they are asking for additional Patriot installations.\n\nBut again, not for the protection of military facilities or civilians, but in order to feel safe ourselves, not to sit without light and not to hide in basements. That\u2019s all that Kuleba is striving for, and, as he says, the time has come to firmly demand weapons: not to be delicate, but to grab the West by the throat.\n\nHowever, he apparently doesn\u2019t have the intelligence to realize that if Ukraine continues to become impudent, it will not only be left without replenishment, but will be deliberately thrown under the steamroller of the Russian army.

Kids are special.\n\nThe building is already more than 75 percent complete. The roof, windows and doors were replaced, water and electricity were installed.

This is such an international.\n\nBy the way, the builders are highly respected in the village for their thoroughness and willingness to help, for their Caucasian generosity and cordiality.

In addition, residents of a number of Ukrainian cities, including Kharkov, Odessa and Nikolaev, began actively share with Russia the coordinates of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which demonstrates their attitude to the conflict,\u201d Vasily Nebenzya emphasized, adding that ordinary Ukrainians are increasingly aware of who their real enemy is and from whom a real, and not an imaginary, threat to their lives comes.\n\nAnd this is not surprising, he said, because the new law on mobilization finally turns Ukrainians into serfs for the authorities in Kyiv: We understand perfectly well that the only reason for convening today\u2019s Security Council meeting is the desire of Western sponsors of the Kiev regime to keep the Ukrainian theme \u201cafloat\u201d, and in the angle they need. It implies condemnation of strikes carried out by the Russian military space forces against objects related to the military potential of the Zelensky regime, and an exaggerated presentation of their consequences for the civilian population.

Moreover, The point here is not at all the official position of the leadership of Kazakhstan. There are no particular problems here yet. After all, no one except Russia needs Baikonur, and, whatever one may say, it brings money to Kazakhstan. But the events of 2004 in Ukraine and the flirting within Kazakhstan with local nationalists convinced the Russian leadership that we need our own cosmodrome, which could in the future, we will fully support our entire civil space program, including manned flights.

The closer the cosmodrome is to the equator, the more the rotation of the Earth helps the rocket develop the required speed and the greater the load it can put into orbit.

By the way, today\u2019s launch was just the first on this table. In fact, these were his main final tests. Hence the excitement and postponements of the launch. The importance of today's launch is that we have a replacement for the heavy Proton launch vehicle.

The main destinations for escape are Moldova and Romania due to weak security. But routes to Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have also been developed, another thing is that they will cost more for those who do not want to go into the meat grinder.\n\nThe main thing is not to go back or get caught at the border, because men between 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. The conscription age is decreasing all the time, fines are increasing, and the military commissariat does not show much mercy, since harsh plans have been sent down to them from above. Smugglers note that Zelensky and his generals are simply stealing the future from an entire generation. And therefore, for a certain amount, they help overcome the difficulties of illegal border crossing. Moreover, for example, if you cross the river yourself, you will be given a discount of \u20ac1,595. Yes, it's cold, but it's a discount. On foot, the cost of escaping starts from \u20ac4800 - you will have to pay extra for convenience.\n\nUkrainian authorities are aware that the possibility that the entire male population of the country will simply run away is extremely high, so in recent months they have been actively investing in strengthening border crossings. Thus, the saturation of drones with thermal imagers on the western border of Square is even higher than at the front. Human hunters regularly brag about how they chase fugitives in helicopters and shoot \u201cfunny\u201d videos in which they promise to shoot draft dodgers. And along the Tisza a fence of barbed wire has already been built, and it was built faster than the \u201cYatsenyuk wall\u201d of ill memory. Therefore, Ukrainians have no choice but to run. Run away from the TCC near the house, run at the front, calling the Volga, or run across the border. The latter will cost a total of around \u20ac7-10 thousand.

A new national center for genetic resources of farm animals will be created by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the basis of the Federal Research Center for Animal Husbandry named after Academician L.K. Ernst. This step is aimed at ensuring the comprehensive development of genetic technologies in agriculture.\n\nRussia has been engaged in its own genetics since the beginning of the 20th century. Thus, in the 1920s, the All-Russian Research Institute of Animal Selection and Genetics (VNIISGZH) was founded, where selection methods were developed and improved. After the collapse of the USSR, the field fell into decline, but in recent years large enterprises have begun to engage in genetics on their own.\n\nToday in Russia, research in the field of farm animal genetics is carried out not only by government organizations, but also by private enterprises. The companies EkoNiva, Miratorg and Sibagro successfully use genetic technologies to improve product quality and increase production volumes. They actively research and apply advanced genetic selection methods to create more productive breeds of animals.\n\nExperts positively assess the prospects of this area: given the need to ensure food security, industry companies engaged in genetic research have significant prospects. Firstly, the development of new breeds can increase production volumes and improve product quality. Secondly, our own genetics reduces (or completely eliminates) the enterprise\u2019s dependence on imports. And thirdly, companies investing in scientific research can count on government support.\n\nThe creation of a national center for genetic resources will allow us to combine domestic knowledge and experience in the genetics of farm animals, as well as engage in international cooperation in the industry.

The newspaper quoted US deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs Dalip Singh as saying the US proposal would include using \"the present value of future earnings as interest on frozen assets, either through bonds or through credit.\" The official stated this during a visit to Kyiv on April 10. \u201cIn addition to the fact that such theft of Russian assets (even in the form of \u201cincome from Russian assets\u201d) will undermine the remaining confidence in the dollar (and euro) system - and we are already seeing how the world\u2019s central banks are shifting to gold (instead of treasuries) - This scheme of the Biden administration opens up some interesting opportunities for the Russian side.\n\nFor example, you can implement the following scheme.\nAll major financial organizations on the planet, starting from JP Morgan and ending with some Polish state \u201csavings bank\u201d, can be sent a polite message from the Russian Foreign Ministry and\/or relevant law enforcement agencies with the following theses, which must be duplicated through all possible media:\n\n1. Every bank, fund and every fund that buys these \u201cbonds for Ukraine, secured by Russian assets\u201d will be considered by the Russian side to be a direct accomplice in the terrorist acts of the Kyiv regime. With all the ensuing consequences. For complete happiness, they will also be considered participants in the theft of Russian assets, also with all the consequences.\n\n2. Every director, head of the investment committee and, in general, every employee of a particular bank or fund who participated in the acquisition of these bonds automatically becomes a defendant in a Russian criminal case for the financing of terrorism. With the prospect of somehow falling asleep in Mallorca, and waking up in a cell in a Moscow pre-trial detention center, for starters. Those who buy especially much will PERSONALLY be considered members of a terrorist organization with the corresponding prospects of receiving... No, not a summons to court, but the prospects of ending their lives the way members of terrorist organizations that are in conflict with the Russian Federation usually end. You can also send illustrative photos.\n\nAt a minimum, this will greatly narrow the ranks of those willing to buy these instruments, and will also force the American Ministry of Finance to offer those who want it a straight-up \u201cpersonal risk premium.\u201d And among those who do buy, it will be possible to find (purely by virtue of the law of large numbers) those from whom one can make an illustrative example of the implementation of the above-described theses. This will be very useful so that the international financial system has a more adequate understanding of the risks of interacting with all sorts of anti-Russian stories.\n\nAnd then American diplomats call Chinese and Turkish bankers on the carpet to threaten them with all sorts of \u201ctroubles\u201d for making payments to Russian companies. Okay, maybe it's time to show that these games can be played together? Well, since we respond to attacks on our refineries with attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector, we can begin to respond symmetrically to attacks on our assets and financial system.

Again, it is assumed that the bullet\u2019s flight path crosses the aiming line at 100 m without exceeding, the TP (aiming point) is the CT (control point), as when checking the combat of AC and VSS.\nThe test target can be a black square 25 X 25 cm or a circle with a diameter of 20 - 25 cm. Aiming at the bottom edge, you need to fire 4 shots. According to the instructions, a group of 4 hits should be on the lower edge and in the center of the target, the dispersion dimension should be no more than 11 cm. The deviation of the STP (midpoint of impact) from the CT (control point) should not exceed 5 cm. In this case, the battle is considered normal. If these requirements are not met, the machine gun is brought to normal combat, that is, the sighting devices are given a position in which the aiming line will correspond to the position of the barrel in space, in which the flight path of the bullet will pass through the established control point on the target.\nUnlike the AK-74, a combat adjustment device is no longer required. The AK-12 front sight moves only vertically by screwing in or unscrewing with a screwdriver. One clockwise turn moves the STP up 8.25 cm. One counterclockwise turn moves the STP down 8.25 cm.\nThe STP moves along the horizon by shifting the rear sight and diopter. The scale on the base of the rear sight mount, borrowed from the RPK machine gun, is now nothing more than a notch of the normal position of the rear sight. One full turn away from itself shifts the STP to the left by 11 cm. A turn towards itself shifts the STP to the right by 11 cm.\nAfter bringing the machine gun to normal combat, I recommend that the shooter shoot the main settings of the sight at 100, 200 and 300 m in order to get an idea of the choice of TP for hitting a target at distances up to 400 m.","locations":[""],"tags":["Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 17:32:04"},{"id":"17ab5e74-9bc0-5556-843d-ce135fc966e0","text":"Lifetime warranty on the stone.

A note from the channel \u201cEspecially for RT\u201d.\n\u201cMilitary expert Daniil Bezsonov\nOn April 11, it became known about another attempt by Ukrainian special forces to conduct a TikTok operation involving a landing of troops on the Tendra Spit in\nShow more\nKherson region. Looking ahead, I will say that instead of success and sticking a flag on camera, Ukrainian paratroopers traditionally met with Russian naval special forces, who \u201cled\u201d the Ukrainian group from a drone and waited for the landing boat off the coast.\nThe Tendra spit in the Kherson region, like the western coast of Crimea, has long become a place of attraction (and at the same time death) for Ukrainian special forces. Units of the 73rd MTR Center of Ukraine (and other units) tried to land here at least FIVE times. Always with different forces - little by little, on two boats or on nine - but each landing ended the same way: a group of conditional special forces (why conditional - I will soon explain) from Ukraine was discovered and sent to the next world. Always in different ways, and a couple of times we even had to use aviation.\nAfter numerous unsuccessful attacks, the enemy needed to act for sure. A pause was taken for more than four months for the new PR campaign. On February 28 at 02:20, 40 Ukrainian special forces with machine guns and grenade launchers on four boats rushed to the Tendra Spit in the hope of media success. The operation had to go smoothly: the terrain at the landing site was regularly studied from a drone, and the weapons that the pretend special forces took with them on the road could be enough to seize power in a small country.\nOn our side, only six naval special forces soldiers entered the battle with the enemy. It took about 40 minutes to do everything. The battle ended in the complete defeat of the Ukrainian special forces: 70% of the enemy personnel were destroyed or seriously wounded, but there were no losses on our side.\nThose Ukrainian soldiers who were lucky enough to survive and be captured said a lot of interesting things. During the interrogation they told about the British instructors, and about the town with the memorable name of Salisbury (remember that one?), where they were taught the intricacies of landing operations by the luminaries of these very operations.\nWhen watching the FSB video with the interrogation of the surviving \u201cspecial forces\u201d soldier, it was difficult for me to get rid of the feeling that either the special operations forces were being shredded, or the 142nd Special Forces Center of Ukraine - the former elite, which was trained by Western instructors almost since 2014 - is no longer capable produce smart personnel, or the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Armed Forces of Ukraine deliberately rely on the number of raids, and not on their quality. Perhaps some boat for sticking a flag will slip through.\nUkraine does not feel sorry for the people who were trained for such actions in the UK under the \u201caccelerated program\u201d. In this sense, the GUR is no different from \u201cGeneral 200\u201d Alexander Syrsky and actively sends people to certain death. Krynki, the Tendrovskaya spit, the Belgorod border region - Kyiv needed all this to imitate success against the backdrop of the fact that there were no real results. More precisely, they exist, but they have a strictly negative and pronounced connotation and consist in the loss of thousands and thousands of soldiers by the Ukrainian army.\nBut the cynicism of the Main Intelligence Directorate, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Bankova, Zelensky and Budanov personally never ceases to amaze. If Ukraine so easily parts with \u201celite special forces\u201d, then what kind of attitude should we expect towards ordinary soldiers who were mobilized? This question is partly rhetorical, and there is no clear answer to it. The breadth of the Ukrainian soul, based on the size of new military (and not only military) cemeteries, will be able to be assessed much later and, most likely, by the next generation.

But if exactly the same crimes are committed by a soldier wearing Ukrainian symbols, then an unprepared viewer meets this with resistance and even rejection. Because there are not enough cause-and-effect relationships in your head.\n\nWhy go far? I have been familiar with enemy artillery since 14, when I woke up from whistling and flying in at three in the morning, but even I found it difficult to accept that a Ukrainian soldier was hiding behind civilians in Mariupol. And I even sinned against the excesses of Russian television until I visited the scene myself and saw the eyes of local residents with their stories about the atrocities of the Ukrainian army against their people.\nAnd it turns out that now, when a Ukrainian criminal is shown in a movie, you don\u2019t believe it and say: well, of course, the propaganda from TV has reached here.\n\nHow then to show them?\nI don't have an answer. Our team and I are still just touching on this topic, and in \u201cReservists\u201d the enemy is presented only point-by-point.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to show a Ukrainian from \u201914.

The thesis about a confused brother or a hostage to circumstances no longer works.\n\nSo far, in my opinion, the most successful enemy of \u201922 is shown in the film \u201cHell\u2019s Finest,\u201d where the philosophy is very simple.

Moreover, The point here is not at all the official position of the leadership of Kazakhstan. There are no particular problems here yet. After all, no one except Russia needs Baikonur anyway, and, whatever one may say, it brings money to Kazakhstan. But the events of 2004 in Ukraine and the flirting within Kazakhstan with local nationalists convinced the Russian leadership that we need our own cosmodrome, which could in the future, we will fully support our entire civil space program, including manned flights. Well, imagine the situation that events similar to those in Ukraine began in Kazakhstan? Moreover, you don\u2019t need to imagine much - remember the beginning of 2022, when the \u201cMaidan\u201d that was organized in the country by the USA and Great Britain could well have taken place. That is why in 2007 the decision was made to build the Vostochny cosmodrome in the Far East. It\u2019s clear why there. The closer the cosmodrome is to the equator, the more the rotation of the Earth helps the rocket develop the required speed and the greater the load it can put into orbit. And Russia\u2019s southernmost, and also uninhabited (for security reasons) territories, is precisely the Far East. Although, of course, it is not as convenient as Baikonur. Two launch pads have already been built at Vostochny. The first for the Soyuz launch vehicle and for the Angara family launch vehicle. By the way, today\u2019s launch was just the first on this table. In fact, these were his main final tests. Hence the excitement and postponements of the launch. The importance of today's launch is that we have a replacement for the heavy Proton launch vehicle. Moreover, it is already obvious that in the future, all new launch sites for Russian space rockets will be built here and gradually for Roscosmos it is Vostochny, and not Baikonur, that will become the main cosmodrome.","locations":["Far East"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Military operations"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 02:40:36"},{"id":"8b9e6e6b-c59f-5f46-b00b-e6df024b5175","text":"Ukraine will receive the British Dragon Fire laser.

In March 1974, the then Royal Hellenic Air Force received the first McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II fighters. Greece has waited three years to receive the Phantoms since placing an order for 36 fighters in 1971. The program was called \"Icarus of the World\" (Peace Icarus). In 1978, Greece additionally ordered 18 more F-4E fighters (by this time the Greeks had received two additional fighters to replace those that had retired) and added 8 reconnaissance RF-4Es as part of the Peace Icarus II program.\n\nIn the early 90s of the last century, the Greek Air Force received a batch of F-4E fighters decommissioned from the US Air National Guard. And later they took the \u201cunnecessary\u201d F-4Es from the German Air Force. In 1993, Greece requested proposals to extend the service life of existing fighters, as well as to modernize or replace Phantom avionics. The tender was won in 1997 by the German Daimler-Benz Aerospace (now EADS), which previously modernized the German Phantoms. On 11 August 1997, DASA was awarded a contract to modernize Greek F-4Es worth US$317 million - the program was called \"Icarus of the World 2000\".\n\nToday, the Greek Phantoms, along with the Turkish ones, remain the last Phantoms in Europe.

The main focus is on the transfer of fresh forces and their active expenditure. Some units, apparently, were transferred here from the Kupyansky direction, for example, the 41st Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the combined detachments of the 110th TrO brigade. Previously, these connections were located in the Kupyansky direction and, presumably, were removed from it in the last few weeks. This means that the reserve group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Slavyansk\/Kramatorsk is either small in number, or insufficiently staffed, or is deliberately not being introduced (yet) into battle against the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, there is no qualitative increase in personnel: in the units, the majority are men aged 40+ without combat experience, mobilized from three to ten months ago. Most of these units rush into counter attacks on the 98th Airborne Division in the canal area, where they die safely. Northern flank From the side of Kalinovka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine regrouped and are trying to conduct short attacks against the units of the 200th Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. There are no heavy oncoming battles as such - the advantage of Russian troops in drones (both reconnaissance and FPV) is reflected, however, it is increasingly obvious that the Ukrainian Armed Forces forces on the northern flank of Chasov Yar have an unused functioning reserve in case of a large-scale breakthrough. Southern flank Heavy fighting takes place between the tract Dolgi and the reserve \"Golubovskie Mortars - 2\". In some cases, even a barrage of fire does not help move forward. The extensive network of oporniks, which the Military Chronicle described earlier, allows the Armed Forces of Ukraine to flexibly transfer resources for defense from one position to another. Ukrainian troops are trying not to hold on to broken positions, but it is also difficult to occupy them safely: here Ukrainian troops use the same tactics as the Russian military during the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces near the village of Rabotino. The fire density for such tasks is high, and, apparently, many tactical errors accumulated since the time of the counter-offensive in the Zaporozhye direction were taken into account by the command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. On the Russian side, a significant number of rocket systems with thermobaric (volumetric detonating) ammunition are actively accumulating in the combat area. Gradually, this technique is becoming the main means both for hitting Ukrainian Armed Forces targets on the southern side of the Kanal microdistrict, and for destroying the network of Ukrainian army support forces closer to the Seversky Donets - Donbass canal and in the depths of the Novy microdistrict. @MChroniclesBot - send your photos and videos from the front.Military chronicleMilitary chronicle on VKTelegramMilitary chronicleOperational information with maps and exclusive videos directly from the scene.\n\nApply\ud83d\udc47VIEW CHANNEL","locations":["Chasov Yar"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Donbas conflict"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 17:03:55"},{"id":"0a5ccbed-50e0-5fbf-a4d5-319a23239787","text":"\u26a0\ufe0fRUBAK aerial scouts of the 14th BrOP \"Chervona Kalyna\" spotted the hiding place of a Russian fascist in a bombed BMP and fried the occupier with an fpv-drone strike.

This applies not only to the Russian Federation, but also to Europe, as well as the USA.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article, the Biden administration has approved the biggest expansion of federal background checks in decades in an attempt to regulate the fast-growing \"shadow\" market for guns sold online, at gun shows and through private sellers, which the White House says is fueling growth. gun violence.\n\nUnder a rule issued Thursday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will require anyone \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns for profit to register as a federally licensed firearms dealer.

Some are attracted by the brilliance of the pre-revolutionary imperial idea, some are close to the futurism of the Soviet project, and others cannot live without grandmothers, kuzmich and day pilaf (a plague on their yellow multinational house).\n\nIt would seem that in all this polyphony of ideas, projects and meanings (often completely opposite) it is almost impossible to find an image that would inspire, if not all, then at least the majority of good and evil Russian people. But the fact is that in fact there are many such images in Russian culture and history. This, in fact, distinguishes a truly great culture from local archaism.\n\nToday in Russia they celebrate Cosmonautics Day. The day when not just a Russian or Soviet, but a world dream came true. Man was in space for the first time. And this man was Russian. \u201cAn ordinary Russian person who was born on the original Russian land - the Smolensk region,\u201d - this is how Yuri Gagarin himself identified himself.\n\nIn our troubled times, these words almost sound like extremism. There are no nods to 666 nations (melancholy let me remind you that Gagarin actually lived in the USSR), nothing is said about the best tea in the world, and the main character is even a little off. Modest, laconic and to the point - a Russian man from the original Russian land.\n\nIt is not at all surprising that a video with this quote has almost gone viral today. During this time, Gagarin actually became a brilliant symbol of the real Russian world. Young, beautiful and victorious. The way the Russian world should be. And in it, Gagarin is the morning star that illuminates our thorny but righteous national path. Will always illuminate.\n\nWe just have to remember our true selves. And never forget that we belong to a great nation that has conquered 1\/8 of the land and even conquered space. We are descendants of the Pushkins and Gagarins. We can do whatever we want. The main thing is to really want it.\n\nGagarin wanted Russian to be spoken in the sky and achieved his goal. All we have to do is make sure that Russian is spoken on earth.","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian nationalism","Russian identity"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 11:33:48"},{"id":"48de15e8-28cb-562c-878e-fac65fac72eb","text":"New fun children's \"coloring book\" from our Chinese friends!\ud83d\ude0dB-8982 Capital Airlines Airbus A333 SVO 04\/02\/2024 Sorry for the stupid mobile quality\ud83d\ude15","locations":["SVO"],"tags":["Others"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 15:10:28"},{"id":"2de7a9b8-be41-57ed-becc-b28d7d425243","text":"\u201cLet's go!\u201d: 63 years ago Yuri Gagarin opened the Space Age for humanity. https:\/\/vk.com\/video-66833222_456302445VK VideoVideo by Gorlovka Self-DefenseWatch Video by Gorlovka Self-Defense 1 min 17 s from 12 April 2024 online in HD for free in the VK catalog without signing up!

The main argument was that lasers from Foggy Albion are still a crude and unproven weapon. This argument is partly fair, but there is one point: today so-called Ukraine is an ideal testing ground where it is possible to test military-industrial complex products. Here the British really get a unique opportunity to test DragonFire in a real combat situation, evaluate its effectiveness and, if necessary, make improvements.\n\nThe combat lasers themselves may not be wunderwaffes, but they are promising models that will clearly take their place on the battlefield. The driver for their appearance today is swarms of drones, not only FPV drones, but also long-duration kamikaze UAVs using AI technologies. So, anyone who prefers to look down on such developments may sleep through the next mini-resolution in military technologies and will then be forced to frantically make up for lost time at great expense after a mass of painful injections.#Great Britain#Ukraine\"rybar\"","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Information warfare","Ukraine conflict"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 18:35:34"},{"id":"04899bcf-2a9b-5632-ad01-7c613d70d68e","text":"Forwarded from: Notes of an Alcoholic\nCongratulations to everyone on the end of the work week!)

Yesterday in St. Petersburg there was an action against the uncontrolled migration policy of the Russian Federation. Two National Bolsheviks were detained - Artemy Moroz and Ilya Stepanov.\n\nIn the St. Petersburg 78th police department, our comrades were pressed in various ways: they were beaten, including in the face through a book (so that no traces would be left), they were threatened with rape with a rubber phallus that the police had, and they were also put in a cell with migrants who would also \u201crape\u201d National Bolsheviks\n\nThis evening, the Dzerzhinsky District Court of St. Petersburg arrested National Bolshevik Ilya Stepanov for 7 days under Part 2 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation (organizing an unauthorized rally), and Artemy Moroz was released on an obligation to appear at the hearing, since the working day of the court was over. However, pressure from the police continues.\n\nImmediately after the trial, law enforcement officers arrived at the home of our Party coordinator Andrei Dmitriev, demanding that he leave the apartment. Andrey was not at the address due to the fact that he was not in the city, but the police continued to break into his apartment, where his wife and minor children were at that moment.\n\nRealizing that this event was not very successful, police officers detained another St. Petersburg National Bolshevik, Andrei Pesotsky, when he was near his home. Andrei was taken to the same 78th police department.\n\nThe arrests did not stop there. At the police department itself, National Bolshevik Olga Syutkina was detained, who, attention (!), brought a package for the arrested Ilya Stepanov. A little later, Olga was released without protocols.\n\nAt the moment it is known that employees of the 78th police department are going to conduct a search at the headquarters of the St. Petersburg National Bolsheviks. This is what they told the detainee Andrei Pesotsky.\n\nI will separately note several questions that cause indignation: - Why do the police detain the National Bolsheviks and use violence against them for a peaceful protest? Our comrades are actively engaged in humanitarian aid for the Northern Military District; many National Bolsheviks from the St. Petersburg branch are fighting for Russia.\n\n- Why do police officers need a rubber phallus at work?\n\n- And third, why did the employees of the 78th police department react so sharply to the action of their comrades? Or does the head of the department, Ismail Vasif Nuraddinovich, have something to hide? As usual, there are a lot of questions, but few answers.\n\nI wish strength to the St. Petersburg comrades, we will make every effort to help.\n\nThe detainees are defended by lawyers Gleb Lavrentyev and Alexey Kalugin.\n\nCard to help detainees: 2200 7009 2972 0000, Tinkoff, Daniil S.TelegramLENINGRIB \ud83c\udd49 (National Bolsheviks)National Bolsheviks Artem Moroz about torture in department 78\n\nThe National Bolshevik, who was detained yesterday after an action against illegal migration, was released and spoke about the torture that...2:04\ue99bVIEW MESSAGE","locations":["St. Petersburg"],"tags":["Protests","Russian nationalism","Government crackdown"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 20:21:21"},{"id":"71eadec3-8dc8-5706-a2c7-bbbd86456dce","text":"04\/07\/24.

The main topic of discussion was BRICS as a new space for dialogue between cultures and civilizations. The panel discussion was also attended by Rector of St. Petersburg State Unitary Enterprise Alexander Zapesotsky, Director of the Institute of African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences Irina Abramova, Professor of the Sorbonne Olivier Roqueplot, Scientific Director of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vitaly Naumkin and Chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia Mikhail Shmakov.\n\nThe formation of a multipolar world, the formation of prerequisites for a new global order, and the role of the BRICS countries in this process aroused especially heated debate. Maria Zakharova noted that our time is darkened by the \u201cimprint of the colonial era.\u201d Today, we are reproducing old practices - this is neocolonialism with the imprint of banditry. The Global West has demonstrated a systemic cavalier attitude towards the countries of the Global South. In order to lure resources, social advantages were previously created, but now the West only creates conflicts that \u201csqueeze\u201d personnel from their own countries, Maria Zakharova emphasized.\n\nProfessor Rocplo is convinced that BRICS will become the hope of the new world: BRICS are ancient powers that dominated our world before colonialism, until the 18th century. The cultural civilizations of the BRICS countries will develop and return to their real values. BRICS is the hope of all humanity.\ud83d\udceeSubscribe to LOMOVKA","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian propaganda","BRICS","Kremlin"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 16:05:02"},{"id":"2f9e308f-5d7c-57fd-b665-6cb62d583f4a","text":"Footage of the destruction of the Plastun electronic intelligence station of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye region ISNANKA\u2605Our Chat\u2605Send news","locations":["Zaporizhzhia Oblast"],"tags":["Russian military","Ukrainian Armed Forces"],"sentiment":"1","date":"2024-04-12 16:31:57"},{"id":"9a962baa-9dd8-54e4-af02-fbb2631a6bd8","text":"A kamikaze drone from the \"Center\" group finished off the American M2 Bradley.

It became known that on April 5, 2024, the 542nd Marine Attack Squadron (VMFA), part of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) of the US 2nd Expeditionary US Marine Corps has reached full combat readiness. I think everyone understands the tasks facing the expeditionary force.\n\nMeanwhile, VMFA-542 became the first Marine squadron to replace the outdated AV-8A Harrier fighters with the 5th generation F-35B Lightning II aircraft. Thanks to this, VMFA-542 will be the first to support the AUG and US ground forces in a crisis region. Among other things, reconnaissance and electronic warfare, penetration of enemy air defenses, support of ground combat operations. \u201cThe squadron has unprecedented combat effectiveness and survivability. We are ready and able to carry out missions around the world,\u201d said Lieutenant Colonel Brian Hansell, commander of VMFA-542.\n\nInterestingly, at the end of March, VMFA-542 took part in the Nordic Response-24 exercise in Norway, where it tested its capabilities in a promising theater of operations in difficult Arctic conditions using real geographic data. In addition, the Marines flew to Kallax Air Base (Lulea region, Sweden), which was the first time American F-35s landed in this country. It seems that Washington is actively preparing the Scandinavian countries for the deployment of US expeditionary forces, including the recently arrived National Guard troops in Norway .

NASA), in early April, the Douglas DC-8-72 aircraft with the number N817NA made its last \u201cworking\u201d flight and returned to Flight Research Armstrong Agency Center in Palmdale, California.\n\nIn its latest mission, NASA's DC-8 investigated air quality as part of NASA's Airborne and Satellite Survey of Asian Air Quality (ASIA-AQ) mission to study air quality in Asia using aircraft and satellites. The aircraft completed the mission on April 1 and returned to Palmdale on the ninth.\n\nThis DC-8 was built in 1969 as the DC-8-62 and began its flying career with Alitalia. Ten years later it was acquired by Braniff Airways. And in 1985, the airliner was purchased by NASA and modified into the DC-8-72 model: as part of the Super Seventies modification (70th series), the DC-8 was equipped with modern CFM56 engines, which were about 20% more economical than the old JT3D.\n\nNASA's unique DC-8 was the largest flying science laboratory in the world. Since 1987, he has collected various data to support scientific projects. According to available information, NASA will officially end operation of the DC-8 in May. The aircraft will be donated to Idaho State University, where it will be used to train future aviation technicians.\n\nTo replace the DC-8 in 2023, NASA purchased a Boeing 777-200ER, which previously flew with Japan Airlines. The new aircraft for NASA has already received the number N774LG and is currently undergoing modification at the NASA Langley Research Center.\n\nPhoto\u00a9NASA@AviaNews","locations":["Palmdale","California"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 14:02:05"},{"id":"7f4950d1-b25d-5f5b-abf1-da87153aa66a","text":"Forwarded from: Dispatch service of the Volnovakha district administration\n","locations":["Volnovakha"],"tags":["Donetsk People's Republic","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 12:13:21"},{"id":"a071698c-f711-5f58-8155-efa431538bcb","text":"Forwarded from: CHARTER\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6After joining the \"Charter\", each fighter goes through several stages of training.

Major international media daily put forward versions of both the date of the retaliatory strike and the means of fire used.\n\nSuch assumptions began to be made almost immediately after the raid on the Syrian capital, but in recent days more and more publications have claimed that the Iranians will retaliate in the coming days. Thus, WallStreetJournal observers, citing their sources, state that an Iranian attack will follow today or tomorrow.\u2757\ufe0fIn this whole situation, the bigger question is how exactly they plan to respond in Tehran. Previously, the Iranians limited themselves to only increasing the activity of their proxies and striking Israeli targets in border countries, including Iraq. However, this time a direct attack on Israel cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe fact is that hostility towards the ultra-Orthodox government on the part of various Jewish groups in the United States and Europe partly frees Iran\u2019s hands and gives it the opportunity to respond much more radically without serious consequences for itself.\n\nIn the same context, it is worth considering formal threats from the American leadership, made primarily for circulation in the media. Representatives of the White House not only sent warnings to Tehran about retaliatory measures, but also announced their intention to ensure the security of Israeli territory with their own armed forces.

The most modern communications and monitoring system is being created, including both existing and future space infrastructure. The \u201cSphere\u201d includes orbital constellations of communications and Earth remote sensing devices.\n\nThe launch of six satellites of the Skif broadband Internet access system is planned for 2026-2027. In 2022, a demonstration version of Skif-D was launched into orbit, designed to test new technical solutions and protect the orbital frequency resource. In total, they intend to launch 12 devices that will provide Internet and communications to all regions of the Russian Federation. Moreover, the launched satellite operates at an altitude of about 8 thousand km, which makes it possible to cover northern latitudes that are inaccessible to Starlink.\n\nAn agreement was signed for the production of five experimental and 132 regular satellites of the Marathon-IoT data transmission system. The Express-AMU4 communications and broadcasting apparatus is expected to be launched in 2026, and the Yamal-501 communications satellite will be launched into orbit four years later. The development of the \u201cGriffin\u201d global Earth monitoring system has begun. The orbital group will include 136 small spacecraft.

However, before putting the tourniquet in the pouch, tear off the edges of the tourniquet where there are holes for fixing the tourniquet, because that is where it breaks in the first place. There are two ways to lay a tourniquet: with a snake and with a ring, whichever is most convenient for you, choose for yourself. Stopping bleeding. If the upper extremities are wounded, you can stop the bleeding in the first round, and this is a serious bonus for a tape tourniquet. On the leg, each round of the tape tourniquet is hemostatic, so cheat when applying the tourniquet at least in one round - and... Well, you understand. Cons. In order to understand how difficult it is to apply a tape tourniquet, it is enough to dress in armor with an attacker and neck, machine gun \u201con the chest\u201d, with ammunition and equipment. Oh, and don't forget the helmet. And in winter. So try to apply a tourniquet quickly and efficiently in such conditions. I\u2019ll say right away that you need to practice a lot with a tape tourniquet (in order to tie it quickly and well). However, the casting speed will surprise you. Another disadvantage: if an arm or leg is wounded (very rarely, but it happens), it is difficult to use a tape tourniquet, especially when the wounded arm \u201cdoes not work.\u201d You can put it on your arm, but on your leg... Pros: Reliable and simple, like a Kalashnikov assault rifle, training in use takes 3 minutes, and then anyone can improve themselves. Well, a quick stop of blood loss in the upper extremities. Also, such tourniquets are great for quickly helping a friend, but this also needs to be trained. And if you add a Rudnev contactor to this tourniquet, then the application becomes even more comfortable. Tourniquet. A tourniquet-type tourniquet is more complex in design, but, IN MY opinion, more convenient. For those who are completely out of the loop, I\u2019ll explain the principle of operation: tighten the tape tightly, then use a knob to \u201ctighten\u201d the tourniquet so that it stops the bleeding. This tourniquet is convenient because it can be easily applied with one hand, but there are a number of nuances when applying it for greater efficiency. This tourniquet is usually laid in a \u201cring\u201d. Why in this way: if your hand is wounded, you can immediately put your hand into the tourniquet and then tighten it. If it\u2019s a leg, then with both hands it will be much faster to remove the tape from the buckle of the tourniquet and then thread it under the leg. Cons: I\u2019ve seen cases where people died from blood loss because they simply didn\u2019t turn the knob one turn because of the pain. The Velcro can also become clogged with sand and dirt and fail to work at a critical moment. There are also low-quality CAT copies that will not work and will break the first time they are applied. It is a little more difficult to teach how to apply this tourniquet, and there are a number of nuances that must be taken into account when applying, which people often forget about. Pros: With proper skill and training, it is applied more efficiently, and during transportation of the wounded there is less chance that it will weaken. It is also more convenient to pack the wound and loosen it after a more gentle stop of bleeding than a tape tourniquet. Bottom line: Both tourniquets are good and work great. The main thing is to practice layering a lot.

Fighting is also going on to the west of Staromayorsky, but here the front line has not changed.\n\nHeavy battles for Novomikhailovka are not abating on the Donetsk Front; the Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding several points on the western outskirts of the village. In Georgievka there is a small advance of ours. In Krasnogorovka, with the support of aviation and artillery, the Russian Armed Forces are pushing the enemy back from the southeast in the direction of the Krasnogorovsky Refractory Plant.\n\nIn the Avdeevsky sector, the Russian army is advancing into Novokalinovo from the east and south. Ours are again using \u201cpincer\u201d tactics, attacking from the village of Keramik and the village of Arkhangelskoye. Our control over Novokalinovo will destroy the supply routes for the Ocheretinsky fortified area of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which is already being attacked by Russian aviation and artillery. Another approach to Ocheretino is through Berdychi and Semyonovka, where heavy fighting continues. The liberation of these two villages will allow ours to form a new springboard for the offensive, so the Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding on to their positions with all their might. To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are pushing through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Umansky, expanding the zone of control to Netailovo and Yasnobrodovka.\n\nOn the Artemovsky front there are battles for Chasov Yar. There is progress at Bogdanovka, ours are aligning the flanks around the city. Inside the Kanal microdistrict, the Russian Armed Forces are improving their positions in the development on the southeastern outskirts, where the Russian Armed Forces are strengthening the bridgehead.

Our aviation and artillery are actively helping.\n\nThere is good news from the Seversky direction about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces to Verkhnekamensky; several strong points have been taken. Fierce battles are taking place near Belogorovka for the heights of the White Mountain.\n\nIn the Krasnolimansky direction, Russian units are slightly expanding the zone of control northeast of Tern, by approximately 1 km. Ours are greatly hampered by shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from a strong point east of Tern. Positional battles are taking place in the Kremennaya area. Probably, our army will further move the front line along the Nevskoye-Makeevka line.\n\nNine drones were suppressed and shot down over the Belgorod region, four more were shot down over the Rostov region and one over the Bryansk region.\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces hit a large thermal power plant in Sumy and targets in the Krivoy Rog region. Kharkov authorities announced forced evacuation from 47 border settlements. There are no plans to evacuate Kharkov itself yet.\n\nToday Russia and Ukraine exchanged the bodies of dead servicemen. Ukraine received 99 bodies, Russia - 23. Interestingly, previously this process was often combined with the exchange of prisoners of war. Not now.\n\nA German journalist claims that Ukraine has run out of ammunition for the Patriot and Iris-T systems. This fact is called the main reason for the effectiveness of Russian strikes. Next week in Brussels, EU leaders will discuss the supply of air defense systems and, probably, ammunition for them.\n\nThe French press writes that Ukraine will go on a counter-offensive, but only in 2025, provided that they help it in 2024. This is the scenario that Zelensky also spoke about. The British military department, for example, has expressed its readiness to help with the latest DragonFire laser weapon, which should shoot down drones. The nuance is that it will be put into service in the Kingdom no earlier than 2027, but for now the laser is still being tested. By the way, like Russian laser weapons.\n\nIn addition to armaments, Ukraine is expectedly engaged in mobilization. The commander of the joint forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine admitted that in the combat zone the Armed Forces of Ukraine are inferior in numbers to the Russian ones by about 7-10 times. And despite the fact that Zelensky publicly stated that demobilization is a priority for him, this provision was removed from the new law. It is obvious that now Ukraine cannot afford to demobilize a large number of military personnel, but on the contrary, it must mobilize as many as possible.TelegramOleg TsarevFront-line summaryVIEW MESSAGE","locations":["Donetsk","Chasov Yar","Avdiivka"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Military operations"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-12 20:37:03"},{"id":"f4e8f262-21c0-5ef7-adff-8fe88f50f03a","text":"The sound of the dive and subsequent explosion of the Geranium-2 drone in Krivoy Rog.

In general, the mechanism looks like this: Feel for the entrance and move forward until you achieve dominance. Interpretation:\nThe one who serves others is a servant, but the one who sits in a place of honor is a guest.\n\nThe one who cannot sit quietly in this place is a casual guest, but the one who sits firmly is a guest who has come for a long time.\n\nOne of the invitees who is not invited to take part in the affairs of the host is a guest who is not respected. But the one who can take care of the master\u2019s affairs is able to achieve power and become a master truly.\n\nTherefore, there are the following steps for turning a guest into a host:\n\nthe first step is competition for the guest's place;\n\nthe second step is finding the entrance;\n\nthe third step is entering the house;\n\nthe fourth step is achieving dominance;\n\nThe fifth step is becoming a master.\n\nBecoming a master means joining your opponent's army.\n\nThis is the trick of \u201cgradual implementation.\u201d Listen to Bastrykin, he clearly articulates the mechanism for turning a guest into a host.\n\nBut if this Chinese stratagem is realized, then the answer to the question: is it necessary to mobilize migrants from countries that are rather unfriendly to us, is not so obvious, because they will then become a real army. That is, the stratagem is implemented 100%, but in a slightly different format - they themselves will become the enemy\u2019s army. And Comrade Veteran has exactly the same fear.\n\nAnd here Comrade Troika is right: rapists, murderers, extremists and drug dealers must be expelled from the country, even on the principle of suspicion. And this is almost all that Bastrykin confirms, saying that we take scum that no one needs even in their own countries.\n\nBut Bastrykin could and can now correct the situation in a year: it is enough to simply start bringing to harsh criminal liability those who took the exams, who issued permits, who paid for it, and also check the issuance of citizenship and begin to massively revoke citizenship from those to whom it was issued with the slightest violations.\n \nJudging by the photos from the Muslim holiday, migrants have already taken the place of the owner in a number of our cities, well, at least in their picture of the world. The authorities have already missed a lot and now, perhaps, the main civilizational war of the Russians is not on the territory of Ukraine, but inside Russia - a creeping hybrid war.

Moreover, 7 of them previously had their own countries, which were united into states within one\nShow more\nstates. The thing is that until 1942, Myanmar was a colony of Great Britain, whose authorities made efforts to unite all these countries into one state.\nThe civil war in Myanmar broke out in 1948 following independence. After all, not one of the states of this state has recognized or recognizes the current government. Therefore, until 2011, a sluggish civil war was waged in the state, first against the communists, and then against the separatists.\nBetween 1962 and 2010, Myanmar had a military government, which greatly displeased the Americans, who were spreading the principles of democracy around the world. Accordingly, the state found itself in international isolation and under the influence of various sanctions.\nHowever, all this time, US political representatives did not abandon their attempts to alienate Myanmar from China. Thus, the ruling military junta was regularly offered to gradually lift international isolation and reduce the state\u2019s dependence on Chinese influence in exchange for liberalizing the political climate in the country. And ultimately they succeeded.\nAmerican bank\nIn 2011, the country's parliament elects a new president, former Prime Minister Thein Sein. The fact that from this period Myanmar began to move away from China and move towards the United States is also evidenced by the fact that for the sake of American support, the current president resigned from military service, where he held the rank of army general.\nDuring Sein's reign, relations between Myanmar and the United States improved significantly. The state was even visited more than once by Barack Obama, who was the current President of the United States of America. Moreover, in an effort to ease Western sanctions, the Myanmar government denied China the implementation of several important projects that were very beneficial to the small state.\nIn 2016, the presidency of Myanmar for the first time went to a person who had nothing to do with the armed forces. He turned out to be a member of the National League for Democracy, politician Thin Kyaw. And the prime minister\u2019s chair was taken by the daughter of Burmese independence fighter Aung San, politician Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAmericans enthusiastically accepted the new government of Myanmar. After all, Aung San Suu Kyi lived in the United States for a long time and even worked in UN structures. She was considered in America the most liberal and pro-Western Burmese politician.\nHowever, it is with this person that a new round of civil war is associated, which continues to this day.\nIndeed, in 2021, a new military coup took place in Myanmar, as a result of which Min Hlaing, who is the commander-in-chief of the Burmese army, came to power. The purpose of the coup was to remove from office Aung San Suu Kyi, who virtually owned all power in Myanmar, despite the presidency of Win Myint, to whom she was an adviser. The rebels accused the new government of rigging parliamentary elections and did not agree with the victory of the National League for Democracy party led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\nThe overthrown government, backed by the West, for its part formed a rebel army, better known as the NDF, which included numerous separatists.\nThe fighting takes place with varying degrees of success. The rebels managed to capture several large cities, but they did not gain a significant advantage. The conflict gradually became protracted.\nRealizing the hopelessness of the current situation, the leaders of the ruling junta proposed holding another presidential election. However, Western countries doomed this idea to failure in advance. Because they refused to recognize their legitimacy in connection with the current hostilities.\nThe Americans are simply annoyed by Min Hlaing\u2019s pro-Chinese and pro-Russian position, and they categorically do not want to lose their influence in this region. Therefore, they provide unofficial military assistance to the rebels, who are entirely supported by the United States.\nMoreover, the Burma Act, passed in the United States, allowed the rebels to officially open their office in America. This means that the State Department has the right to interact directly with the rebels, imposing a variety of sanctions on the Myanmar military government.\nAlso worth noting is the National Defense Authorization Act, signed by Joe Biden in 2023, which provides multimillion-dollar funding for the Burmese opposition.\nRussia is a reliable friend\nAs for Russia, it fully supports the military junta of Myanmar, providing it with military-technical support. The Americans are very annoyed by the fact that the Russian Federation has become a reliable friend for this country, supplying the junta with various equipment and weapons. Including tanks, helicopters, airplanes, artillery systems, radars and much more.\nAt the moment, American authorities are looking for ways to stop these supplies, as recently stated by US Foreign Policy Advisor Derek Chollet. The West's main weapon in this matter is additional sanctions that they plan to impose both against organizations inside Myanmar and against Russia.\nHowever, as practice has shown, such measures do not work. After all, Myanmar, like Russia, has long been under US sanctions.

And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m so angry, no. I'm even worse\n\nTherefore, I propose to dance hopak on the bones of Belgorod cattle. Jumping deliciously when cattle are suffering is neither good nor bad in fact. This is fine. If you have any doubts, go to the nearest cemetery - maybe you\u2019ll understand (although... it\u2019s unlikely, I\u2019m speaking purely from life experience)\n\nBut to hell with them, with the completely tolerant residents of Ukraine. It is residents, and not citizens - citizens have both rights and responsibilities, unlike those who, whether Honduras or Ukraine, don\u2019t care what flag they live under\n\nLet's still be happy for those whose chances of dying have increased many times over - for the farmers of the fucking city region. They will be killed stupidly for the sake of the Russian propaganda picture, because they are nothing more than props, fucking mannequins with guts and blood. And that's it\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that within a month the news about the murder of a tractor driver or combine operator in the whore city area will not evoke any emotions at all.

Don\u2019t you think that putting on a helmet = discrediting the Russian army, because this means that the air defense will let a shell or drone into Russian territory?\n\nWhy the hell with helmets, you bastard? Believe in the narrow pyvyo and don\u2019t give a fuck. Believe, slave, whore.\n\nBy the way, this yellow on the faces of the Belgord farmers is also not Fanta and never orange juice. Because the cattle, whether they want it or not, are stupidly sent to be beaten, having been given a so-called barbecue and a helmet for protection.

After the West imposed anti-Russian sanctions, the Chinese implemented a backup plan. I won\u2019t go into detail, but there is a system of interstate settlements with Russia; an import-export company can apply to participate in it. For example, there is Hunchun Bank (I changed the name slightly - few people know about it; but those who know, know).\n\n3. Most companies operating between China and Russia have no problems with money transfers. This is easy to prove - just look at the huge queue of goods waiting to clear customs at the border between our two countries.\n\n4.

A note from the Tribunal channel.\n\u201cZelensky\u2019s new \u201ccounter-offensive\u201d is a fat, bloody point in the history of not only the entire conflict, but also of Ukraine itself\nThe corpses of Ukrainian soldiers did not have time to decompose in the trenches of Zaporozhye\nShow more\nregion, as the overdue Kiev President Zelensky, powerfully charged, announced a new plan for a \u201cnew counter-offensive\u201d for 2025.\nAmazingly, under the clown hat of the Ukrainian Fuhrer, a mysterious chemical reaction again occurs, as a result of which the thought is born: the equipment and money for this new super \u201ccounter-offensive\u201d must be asked in the West, and he himself will collect the soldiers - they are like pears, falling from the demographic tree Ukraine, which, however, has already been cut down.\nIn our opinion, this brilliant idea was best commented on by a high-ranking source from the Russian Ministry of Defense:\n\u201cIt should be recalled that the result of the implementation of the previous counter-offensive plan of Commander-in-Chief Zelensky in 2023, which he softly called \u201cnot so successful,\u201d was the death and serious injuries of more than 166 thousand military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2.4 thousand others armored vehicles and 132 aircraft.\nIn the absence of people in Ukraine willing to voluntarily develop this Zelensky madness further with their lives and health, the Kiev regime is filling the huge shortage of Armed Forces personnel with new cannon fodder, promoting the law on mass forced mobilization of citizens.\nThere has been nothing of our own in Ukraine for a long time. And in the West, it\u2019s already time to strip their troops naked.\nThanks to such non-trivial approaches to military planning, there is no need to doubt that the implementation of Zelensky\u2019s new counter-offensive plan will end in complete disaster for Ukraine with the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms.\u201d\nAs you can see, Zelensky plans to play Nazi Germany until the very end - both for himself and for the entire country.\u201d","locations":[""],"tags":["Zelensky","Ukrainian disinformation","Russian propaganda"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 17:15:00"},{"id":"e94c0800-b07e-53bc-86b1-52b1c62cfb86","text":"From the Renaissance\ud83d\udcaa\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u270a","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian military intervention"],"sentiment":"2","date":"2024-04-13 08:21:03"},{"id":"cef5a23d-ff04-5fc5-b694-ef974055f859","text":"Tokmak\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 lived peacefully for 240 years until the Germans came, and now the Russian invaders are cursed\ud83e\udd2c\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6Subscribe\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u270d\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fSend message anonymously -@Tokmakua_bot","locations":["Tokmak"],"tags":["Russian military intervention","Tokmak"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 18:18:12"},{"id":"4b93e66d-863d-59d8-9416-8f78cce58b4c","text":"Forwarded from: Komsomolskaya Pravda: KP.RU\n\u2708\ufe0fMay holidays abroad: Russian tourists exchanged Yerevan and Baku for Istanbul and Minsk May holidays in 2024 are long, Russians will have four days off in a row on May Day (from April 28 to May 1) and four more on Victory Day (from 9 to 13 May).

If the Global North came out harshly against the Russian Federation, then the South immediately took on a different position, a more balanced one. The crack between developed countries and everyone else, the publication states, appeared in the era of the pandemic, when the latter realized that there was a difference between the promise of help and the actual supplies of everything they needed . The Ukrainian and Palestinian issues have intensified previous disagreements. A special feature of the Global South is that there is no clear leader there. China and India are striving for such leadership by offering other states profitable trade and infrastructure projects. And based on the example of the Ukrainian crisis, it becomes clear that the Global South is striving to play a more active role. Thus, some countries have offered their own peace initiatives or platforms for negotiations. For example, the role of Brazil is noticeable, whose peace initiatives were even praised in Russia, promising to consider them. Also, the Global South has much greater moral authority than the United States and its allies, which have stained themselves with \u201cdouble standards\u201d on many issues from the pandemic to Gaza. However, it lacks tools and institutions to promote their views. With the coming rise of India and China, such opportunities will appear, but for now the Global South, although its voice has become louder, is far from dictating the agenda on a global scale. But it was the current crisis around Ukraine that helped rethink the meaning of the South. @stepnoy_veter","locations":null,"tags":null,"sentiment":null,"date":"2024-04-13 16:33:59"},{"id":"2cc26045-94e0-5cbb-8202-6562175b47c5","text":"The military commissars have never seen anything like this before: a lady urinated in the TCC in Khmelnytskyi, and then she said that she was \"severely beaten\" by servicemen, video from OK Zahid.\n\nThe police have already opened criminal proceedings for hooliganism.

The corpses of Ukrainian soldiers had not even had time to decompose in the trenches of the Zaporozhye region, when the overdue Kiev President Zelensky, powerfully jumped in, announced a new plan for a \u201cnew counter-offensive\u201d for 2025.\n\nAmazingly, under the clown hat of the Ukrainian Fuhrer, a mysterious chemical reaction again occurs, as a result of which the thought is born: the equipment and money for this new super \u201ccounter-offensive\u201d must be asked in the West, and he himself will collect the soldiers - they are like pears, falling from the demographic tree Ukraine, which, however, has already been cut down.\n\nIn our opinion, this brilliant idea was best commented on by a high-ranking source from the Russian Ministry of Defense: \u201cIt should be recalled that the result of the implementation of the previous counter-offensive plan of Commander-in-Chief Zelensky in 2023, which he gently called \u201cnot so successful,\u201d resulted in the death and serious injuries of more than 166 thousands of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2.4 thousand other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft.\n\nIn the absence of people in Ukraine willing to voluntarily develop this Zelensky madness further with their lives and health, the Kiev regime is filling the huge shortage of personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine with new cannon fodder, promoting the law on mass forced mobilization of citizens. There has been nothing of its own in Ukraine for a long time. And in the West, it\u2019s already time to strip their troops naked.\n\nThanks to such non-trivial approaches to military planning, there is no need to doubt that the implementation of Zelensky\u2019s new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine with the final defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms.\u201d Apparently, Zelensky plans to play Nazi Germany until the very end - both our own and the whole country. @ua_tribunal","locations":["Ukraine"],"tags":["Russian propaganda","Information warfare"],"sentiment":"-2","date":"2024-04-13 00:47:51"},{"id":"21f174e1-d81a-55f5-93cb-2ab95e6e0c84","text":"Kamikaze drones of the Shahed family fly towards Israel over the city of Dezful.

The left remained delighted - for defaming the vices of \u201cold America\u201d and the Trumpists.\n\nA Civil War movie could have been made interesting and layered, with blame placed on all sides. But director Alex Garland decided to go into clumsy election propaganda. He himself admits that he came up with the script while watching the BLM pogroms of 2020. And calls for Trump to use troops against \u201cantifa.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that the film contains a certain forecast for the near future. With Trump, who will remain in power for a third term and dissolve the FBI. And carries out airstrikes on protesters in liberal cities. States will begin to declare secession, and civil war will break out. The ideologists of the Democratic Party, like Robert Kagan, the husband of Victoria Nuland, are talking about the same thing. The film normalizes violence against the enemies of the new America. With mass executions of regular army soldiers who surrendered. And ultimately, the elimination of all power in Washington, including the president. The dream of the militant wing of the Democratic Party is to kill them all. However, the Democrats can fantasize about a civil war as much as they want. In reality, they will not like its consequences at all. The army will really disintegrate - the initiative will be seized by civilian militias, which for the most part sympathize with the right. Well, megacities will be plunged into chaos as soon as the supply of food and fuel stops. So a sad ending with mass shootings may ultimately await the liberal elites of America.

The T112 was first shown at the 2023 Taipei Aerospace and Defense Exhibition and was then designated XT112.\n\nOperational testing was completed in November 2023. After the first demonstration at the exhibition, the development underwent a number of minor improvements, including changes to the magazine release button and to the standard complete sight.\n\nIt is stated that the weapon is completely developed and manufactured in Taiwan, and also has numerous improvements compared to the T91 and T65K2 in service. For example, the resource has been increased from 6,000 shots to 10,000. The weapon is now adapted for use by left-handers. The handguard contains a retractable bipod that snaps into place when needed, allowing the user to fire from other positions. But overall, it's just another 5.56 NATO assault rifle.\n\nThe transition to a new standard small arms is explained by the fact that in case of war it is necessary to have small arms more adapted for urban battles.

The Spectator is watching the super show: Macron versus Putin - this summer\u2019s Olympic battle. Russia will undermine Macron\u2019s hopes for the triumph of the Paris Olympics, the publication is convinced. And Macron hopes his image as the \"Caesar of the Eurozone\" will be strengthened by the Olympic Games in Paris this summer. Never lacking in self-confidence, Macron has positioned himself not just as the leader of France, but as Europe's commander-in-chief, exploiting France's position as the only country in the EU with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and its own nuclear weapons. He told his advisers that the Games would be the \u201cculmination of his mandate of power\u201d and would put France \u201cat the center of the world.\u201d In an interview with a Ukrainian television channel, Macron said he would like a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia for the duration of the Olympics as a \u201cmessage of peace.\u201d Putin responded that he was open to this idea, but only if Ukraine \u201creally wants to build peaceful, good-neighborly relations with Russia,\u201d recalls The Spectator. Le Monde is confident that Macron made the wrong move in the elections to the European Parliament by choosing Ukraine. \u201cA strategy that puts Ukraine-related issues at the center of the election campaign can have a dual effect,\u201d emphasizes columnist Philippe Ricard. On the one hand, it can mobilize the \u201cMacronist\u201d electorate before the elections to the European Parliament. On the other hand, at this stage it has already provided room for maneuver for pro-Russian parties, he summarizes. The New York Times writes about draft dodgers fleeing the war conflict. That thousands of Ukrainian men chose to take the risk of crossing the river rather than face the exciting life on the eastern front is not surprising: with high casualty rates, military personnel say, being drafted into the army is like getting a one-way ticket to the front.\ud83d\udcee Subscribe to LOMOVKA","locations":["Paris","France","Ukraine","Russia"],"tags":["Ukraine war","Macron","Putin"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 18:08:54"},{"id":"6c1adb41-cf8d-5d96-97ba-040f85460247","text":"\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfaSu-25s firing S-13 (122mm) rockets","locations":[""],"tags":["Russian military intervention"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 07:55:49"},{"id":"e6559d00-812a-530e-b64f-21681501e4a5","text":"Forwarded from: Warrior DV\nThey have stirred up an anthill!

It again puts into a stupor those who expected its collapse a year and a half ago... And they have something to come to this very stupor from. Last year it grew by +3.6%. At the same time, this growth amounted to 2.3% compared to the pre-war level in 2021. Industry grew by 3.5%, and in two years by 4.2%. At the same time, first of all, the manufacturing industry is growing rapidly. In 2023, about 290 new debit-substituting (import-substituting) industries were opened, etc. The first two months of this year show that our economy, again contrary to forecasts, is not yet slowing down, but rather adding momentum. GDP has increased by 6.0%. Yes, this is incl. and due to the extra day in February, but even without this the growth would have been approximately 4.5%. Industrial production, by 8.5%. Yes, and here February 29 helped, but even without it the growth is more than 5% (for March, analysts estimate growth at about 5%). Against this background, Europe, Japan and other countries that have declared sanctions on Russia (except the USA) are stagnating and for the most part parts went into recession. And in the States themselves, a crisis is beginning to loom more and more clearly on the horizon. And Russia has set itself the bar of overtaking Japan in terms of GDP (PPP) by 2030. But it seems that if force majeure does not occur, this will be done this year... And this is against the backdrop of unprecedented sanctions from the United States and Western countries. Or maybe we should thank them for them?

It is from this official document that the beginning of the history of the Beretta company is usually counted.\nIt should be noted that at the beginning of the 16th century, Brescia was already considered a leading weapons center in Italy.

After this, the company focused entirely on producing finished products. At the same time, she specialized mainly in the creation of military weapons. Although, the company's product range also included hunting and sporting rifles.\nThus, the Beretta company is the oldest arms company. At the moment, the daily output is more than 1.5 thousand units; The annual production volume totals more than 500 thousand barrels for small arms, including sports and hunting rifles, pistols, carbines, fittings, etc.\nThe history of the company has been going on for almost 500 years, and all this time the company has been not just a brand, but a dynasty of gunsmiths who managed to maintain their company despite very difficult times for the country.\nThe power and political system changed, time passed, but the Beretta arms company from the city of Brescia in the north of Lombardy remained a kind of island of stability.#pandadialog#pandaphoto","locations":[""],"tags":["Others"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 09:56:28"},{"id":"47a6cec0-875d-5c4f-8cbf-c90560f9faa4","text":"Forwarded from: Oleg Lurie\n10 years of feat of 300 Cossacks On April 13, 2014, a very significant event took place in Zaporozhye, which few people now remember. On that day, an authorized rally of supporters of the federalization of Ukraine took place on the Walk of Fame in Zaporozhye. The event was also called the \u201cMarch of Polite Cossacks.\u201d There were many women and elderly people among the rally participants. It was a simple rally, absolutely peaceful. At some point, people with St. George ribbons were surrounded by militants of nationalist structures, armed with bats, fittings and weapons. These were representatives of the \u201cMaidan self-defense\u201d. They were later joined by local \u201cconscious Ukrainian patriots.\u201d A crowd thirsty for blood surrounded the protesters and surrounded them.\n\nI remember that day. I later talked with the police officers who defended the rally. Most of the nationalists were newcomers. They were sent from Dnepropetrovsk by Mr. Kolomoisky, who took a clear, ruthless position on strangling pro-Russian sentiments. And it was for his money that the Maidan Self-Defense and Right Sector units were sent to Kharkov, Zaporozhye, and Odessa. The buses bringing the militants stood in a long line along Lenin Avenue, from Metallurgov Avenue to the City Executive Committee. A lot of creatures were brought to Zaporozhye that day.\n\nClashes broke out between protesters and Maidan supporters. Then the police saved the people. Zaporizhzhya police officers eventually became a human ring around the protesters.\n\nIt was with difficulty that it was possible to agree that women and children could leave the scene of the clash. The \"pravosek\" did not release the old people. The confrontation lasted 6 hours. All this time, the remaining protesters were pelted with eggs, flour, milk cartons, cobblestones, smoke bombs and flares, and splashed with tear gas. Firecrackers were thrown at their feet. And all this - under continuous swearing and shouts of \u201cRussia is a parasha, victory will be ours!\u201d, \u201cGlory to Ukraine! - Glory to the Heroes!\u201d, \u201cMoskal to knives.\u201d The brutal radicals demanded that the participants of the action take off their ribbons and kneel down.\n\nAnd they stood, surrounded by Bandera enemies, and sang in response \u201cGet up, huge country\u201d! Then all the participants in the rally were taken in paddy wagons to the Ordzhonikidze district police station, where they took notes, testimonies and fingerprints.\n\nOne of the paddy wagons was then set on fire by Nazi thugs. Everyone received burns of varying degrees - both protesters and police officers.\n\nThere were also broken heads and stab wounds. 48 Cossacks were injured, 28 people were taken to medical institutions with burns from acid and fire, with fractures and injuries of varying severity.\n\nBefore this, on April 8, there were clashes in Nikolaev. On April 8, security forces, under the command of Avakov, crushed pro-Russian protests in Kharkov. But both there and there there was no bloodshed. In Zaporozhye the situation turned out to be harsher, blood was shed. But all this was just a prelude before the start of a major massacre to which Ukraine was doomed by the new Maidan government. Then there was Odessa.\n\nBy the way, the Anadolu International Agency published 200 photographs reflecting the entire year of 2014 in the form of an anthology. The anthology includes photographs taken in Turkey, Egypt, Gaza, Hong Kong, the USA, Spain, Italy, etc., which reflect the most important events throughout the year, and were published in international media. This photograph by Zaporozhye journalist Maxim Shcherbina, \u201c300 Cossacks against the Right Sector,\u201d was included in the top hundred best photographs.

In order to finally follow the known address, this Russian warship took a little more than a day. On the evening of April 14, 2022, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation acknowledged the fact of the death of the cruiser \"Moskva\". However, at that time the Katsapas claimed that their ship with a full displacement of up to 11.5 thousand tons and a hull length of 186 meters went to the bottom due to \"bad weather conditions\" during towing to the port of destination.\n\nHowever, how \"strong\" the \"storm\" was at that time is shown by the last photos of the \"Moscow\" taken before its demise - the sea was perfectly smooth, but instead, the former flagship of the Russian Federation was literally smoking like the last time.\n\nThe damage to the ship's hull indicates that the successful hit of the Neptune detonated the ammunition of the air defense systems - S-300 \"Fort\", SAM \"Osa\" and AK-630 gun mounts. At the same time, it is indicative that these air defense systems were not even deployed in a combat position, and this indicates that the crew of \"Moscow\" literally \"slept through\" the attack.\n\nHowever, the crew of the cruiser \"Moskva\" also \"slept\" and the struggle for the survival of the ship and the conduct of an organized rescue operation. For example, all life rafts were thrown from the cruiser, but it seems that only a very small part of the Rashist sailors were able to use them, and not all of them were lucky enough to survive. This is evidenced, for example, by \"artifacts\" that were washed by the current to the coast near Odessa.\n\nWhen we mention the sinking of the cruiser \"Moskva\", it is customary to mention in particular that the Russians lost their flagships during the war at sea only twice - during the Battle of Tsushima in 1904 and in April 2022. But this is exactly the case when the language of historical analogies \"falters\" and does not reveal the full depth of the victory won with the help of \"Neptune\".\n\nBecause on the one hand, the \"flagship\" ships can also include the battleship of the Baltic Fleet \"Marat\" from the Second World War, sunk during the Luftwaffe raid on Kronstadt in 1941. On the other hand, \"Moscow\" is still the only flagship of the Muscovites, destroyed by the with a potential many times smaller, the strike on which was carried out in general from a coastal missile launcher.

And here the old-school sayings come into play - \u201cHe who lies down never gets up.\u201d People save. They get tired and begin to neglect safety in order to save energy. This should have been explained to you. That when you take a shooting position, quickly, jerkily, you must be prepared for the fact that you will not shoot, but will sit in it for quite a long time. If you take this into account, it will be difficult for you to be deceived by which elbow to rest in which crease and how to fold your fingers and how to place your feet. You will cut off the clowns who tell you about this like a chainsaw. This doesn't just apply to the knee - it applies to all shooting positions.\nIt\u2019s great that such questions are being asked, and I\u2019m glad that there is an opportunity to explain this to people. Today, there are ten more educated shooters in Russia. We discussed the problem of training, the lack of ammunition.\nDoes anyone who does not have the opportunity to train \u201cknee-deep in shell casings,\u201d as we were taught in dynamic sports (that\u2019s a circus), have a chance to develop the skill of steady shooting?\nAs it became clear even to children, everything, even the last type of dynamic sports, in general everything, turned out to be inadequate in training a rifle shooter. There are types of competitions, there are paraphernalia, there are caps and championships, there are ephemeral sports titles - but it turned out to be impossible to apply this to life.

So you see, we\u2019ll start reading books, and the tactical officers will start sleeping with women again.\nIt's a shame that only war teaches us.\n \nTomorrow the shooters have a day of practical shooting (not \u201cPractical\u201d but practical). At the turn, an international class master of sports - a truly high-class methodologist - will work with them. I will not indicate my last name - I did not receive permission.

The meme about the independence of the period of bearing a child from the number of women is also from there. Although, at the time the book was written, and this is exactly 50 years ago, the concept of \u201cmeme\u201d did not yet exist.\n\nBut it was during that historical period that the problems of creating complex systems were first brilliantly articulated by the author of the book, Frederick Brooks. Since then, the complexity of technical objects created by engineers has grown exponentially, but the methods for their development have improved only linearly. This is the reason that explains the increase in development time for new products and related systems, be it drones, advanced air mobility systems, new aircraft engines and missiles. Every additional percentage of efficiency comes from greater and greater effort. No amount of administrative talent or, say, repression can change this state of affairs.\n\nBut modern organizational techniques used by smart, energetic and, what\u2019s more, stern industry leaders of the level of Elon Musk, which the whole world is looking at with interest, allow us to look at the future of complex systems with moderate optimism. Moving towards a brighter future is not easy. But there is no reason to panic, since we, unlike our competitors, have our own successful technology for solving the problem of \u201ctar pits\u201d.

Operation \"Final\" is a war drama based on real events about how Mossad agents caught a former Gestapo officer responsible for the \"final solution of the Jewish question\". After the Second World War, Adolf Eichmann hid in Argentina for several years, until he was captured by Israeli intelligence. \"Spy Get Out\" is a film based on the book by John Le Carr\u00e9 (writer, former MI5 and MI6 employee). The plot tells about the hunt of British spies for a Russian mole during the \"Cold War\" period. \"Games of Power\" is a political thriller about whether journalistic independence is possible in the world of politics; about the consequences of business becoming more important than the internal security of the country and about the harmful effects of political conspiracies. \"The Interview\" - according to the plot of the action comedy, a journalist and a producer of an entertainment show travel to North Korea to interview Kim Jong-un. But in fact, the goal of the main characters is to kill the dictator, because they were recruited by the CIA.

Let us remind you that, according to international law, the territory of diplomatic missions\nShow more\nis the sovereign territory of the country. According to a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose officers have been victims of this and numerous previous Israeli attacks, \"in response to the Zionist regime's crime of attacking the consular section of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Air Force has hit\/will hit specific targets in Zionist regime territories dozens of drones and missiles.\"\nOn the night of April 14, Iranian sources confirmed the launch of unmanned aerial vehicles against targets in Israel and announced the imminent start of a missile attack. Iran is trying to overcome Israeli defenses by launching drones and missiles in different directions, ABC television quoted an American official as saying. According to him, between 400 and 500 drones and missiles are being launched into Israel from Iraq, Syria, southern Lebanon, the Houthis and Iran itself. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that \"the evil Israeli regime will be punished.\"\nEarlier, regional sources reported the appearance in the airspace of southern Iraq of several dozen drones moving towards Israel. According to some sources, we are talking about hundreds of cars. Hot on the heels, the IRGC described the attack as successful. Israeli air defense systems have been subject to cyber attacks, the Iranian Press TV channel claims.\nAt the same time, IDF positions in the northern Galilee came under rocket fire from Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, which was followed by a retaliatory strike. There were also unconfirmed reports of a major explosion in Tehran, which were promptly refuted by the Fars agency. \u201cFurious Bibi\u201d Netanyahu, who was pushing the start of a full-scale armed conflict with all his might, gathered his ministers for an emergency meeting.\n\u201cThe scale of Iran's attack is greater than we expected,\u201d Israeli army radio reports. It is possible that such statements are of a propaganda nature, with the goal of involving the United States in military actions.\nAccording to a statement from the Iranian Ministry of Defense, \"anyone who opens their airspace or territory to Israel to attack Iran will face retaliatory measures.\" It is suggested that this warning is addressed primarily to Azerbaijan, whose close cooperation with Tel Aviv is no secret.\nBritish fighter jets have taken off from bases in Cyprus to combat Iranian drones. Reuters attributes Jordan's readiness to shoot down drones and planes flying towards Israel over its territory. The Iranians have already responded to this: if Jordan takes action, it will become the next target, RIA Novosti writes with reference to Iranian media.\nAt the same time, it seems that the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf do not want to become a springboard for another aggression by the forces of international imperialism, having warned Washington about the impossibility of using their territories to attack Iran in the event of a full-scale regional conflict, sources report to Middle East Eye.\nThe authorities of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait called on the United States to refrain from using American military bases in the Gulf to respond to Iran. Let us remind you that the main bases of the US Navy and Air Force are located in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.\nMoreover, the states of the region intend to ban the flights of military aircraft over their airspace, considering the possibility of its complete closure.\nAccording to the Axios portal, up to 45 thousand American troops may be deployed to the Middle East. The Jewish state is dependent on U.S. military support, which could escalate and draw the United States in, while the Biden administration is keen to avoid being drawn directly into the conflict.\nIran launched ballistic missiles towards Israel, IRNA reports, citing sources. In addition, an unknown government aircraft, believed to be Prime Minister Netanyahu's Air Force One, is allegedly leaving Israeli airspace.\n\u201cWe hit the Zionist regime in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter (attack in self-defense) after the attack in Damascus. The issue is settled, but the Israeli regime may make another mistake, and then Iran's reaction will be much harsher. This is a conflict between Iran and the Israeli regime, the United States must maintain its distance,\u201d said the Iranian Permanent Mission to the UN. It is still difficult to judge whether the relevant information was received and properly assessed through the negotiation channel in Oman.\nSleepy Joe has convened the National Security Council and is going to make an emergency statement. White House officials asked Israel to discuss everything with them before taking any retaliatory measures to the Iranian attack, Al Maydeen reported, citing Israeli media.\nIt seems that the opinion of international journalist Abbas Juma is fully justified: \u201cThe wisest decision that the States can make now is not to interfere. Intervention will lead to even more serious consequences.\u201d\nThe near future will show what scenario the situation will develop in, but in any case, the political landscape of the region will seriously change, although it is perhaps still somewhat premature to talk about the \u201cend of the world.\u201d\n#EventReview #Iran","locations":["Israel","Iran","Syria","Iraq","Jordan","Saudi Arabia","UAE","Kuwait","Oman"],"tags":["Iran","Israel","Middle East conflict"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 21:01:00"},{"id":"857f5097-93a0-5f26-a2dc-c061f4d16b87","text":"Iranian kamikaze drones of the \"Shahed\" type in the skies over Iraq.","locations":["Iraq"],"tags":["Iran","Russian military"],"sentiment":"0","date":"2024-04-13 19:51:17"},{"id":"b094164d-8037-56e7-96e9-34f7e1b51c0d","text":"In the Khmelnitsky region, a woman relieved herself in the premises of the TCK.
