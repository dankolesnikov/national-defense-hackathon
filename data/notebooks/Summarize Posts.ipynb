      "In the past, the debate stopped at the period of the 10th century, when Tadmecca (present-day Essouk) became the center of trans-Saharan trade👳 Al-Bakri - an Arab explorer of the 11th century first gave Tadmecca an etymology, according to him the name is Berber and means “reminiscent of Mecca.” On the other hand, some the representatives of the Immadas mention in their paternal genealogy an ancestor named Ademakka, a name whose name would mean “one who camps,” that is, “established.”🕌The traveler describes it as: “a huge city that is better built than Ghana or Kaukau [present-day Gao].\" It is known from him that at that time it was occupied by Muslim Berbers. There were many merchants in the city and coins of pure unminted gold flowed. Later, the name Essuk [Market] was assigned to it, since “Every person who wanted to buy something went to Essuk,” according to Humer, the leader of one of the branches of the Tuaregs. Around the middle of the 11th century, a war takes place (how else?) between Tadmekka and Ghana, with the support of the Almoravids. It all ended with the conquest of the city, as a result of which the population switched from Ibadism to the Sunnism of the Maliki madhhab.\n",

Political scientist Anton Bredikhin told Izvestia about this. “We see that until martial law has been introduced and a new format of governance has not been created in the country, and it has not been created in the end, only the Verkhovna Rada has legitimacy. This is exactly reminiscent of the events of 2014. <...> It was then that the Verkhovna Rada, after the escape of (ex-President of Ukraine Viktor - approx.) Yanukovych, took over all functions, including the appointment of the first person of the country,” he said. In the current situation, the parliament must appoint someone “as acting president,” Bredikhin added. He added that in this format a “balance of legitimacy” but, in many respects, “illegality” can be maintained. At the same time, in this case, the reaction of the West will also be important. “How the West will perceive this and how Russia will perceive it.

      "🇰🇵🇯🇵For a year now, since the spring of 2023, there have been rumors that Japan and the DPRK are trying to organize a summit meeting. Fumio Kishida has stated several times that he is ready to meet with Kim Jong-un in order, in particular, to discuss the issue of citizens of his country abducted by North Korean intelligence services from Japanese territory between 1977 and 1983. However, at the end of March 2024, several events occurred that led, if not to the failure of these negotiations, then to their suspension. On March 25, Kim Yo Jong issued a new statement in which she again repeated the old position of the DPRK that the issue of abductions has already been resolved, and Pyongyang is not ready to discuss it, as well as the issue of the North Korean nuclear missile program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kukmin University professor Andrey Lankov talks in detail about the background of the issue related to the abductions and assessed the prospects for normalization between Tokyo and Pyongyang. Apparently, yes, the year-long epic, which began with secret contacts in Southeast Asia in the spring of 2023, has reached a dead end. But this, of course, does not mean that she will always remain in this impasse. The interest of the parties in contacts is quite high. Sooner or later everything will become active again. But with a high probability this will not happen in the coming months, and perhaps not even in the coming years.\n",
      "\n",
      "What North Korea needs is diplomatic recognition and compensation. And under these conditions, the North Korean side is not ready to lay out its only trump card on the table - resolving the issue of kidnapped Japanese citizens. Naturally, if they have this card, they may not have it, because time is not on their side in this matter. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the perception of the problem of abductees in Japan is also decreasing over time. In this movement, a very important role was played by the parents of the missing, their closest relatives, some of whom died, some are already in more than old age and, naturally, cannot show the activity that they showed before. Therefore, on the one hand, Koreans have less opportunity to pay for a possible shift in relations with Japan - their, cynically speaking, “political currency”, that is, those kidnapped, living or dead, are gradually losing value. On the other hand, the Japanese side has less and less desire and need from the North Koreans to get all this. https://russiancouncil.ru/analytics-and-comments/interview/normalizatsiya-mezhdu-tokio-i-pkhenyanom-proizoydet-ne-v- blizhayshie-mesyatsy-i-mozhet-dazhe-ne-v-bl/russiancouncil.ruNormalization between Tokyo and Pyongyang will not happen in the coming months and maybe...For a year now, since the spring of 2023, there have been rumors that Japan and North Korea are trying to organize a summit meeting.

Having stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will enter Crimea last year, ex-commander of US troops in Europe Ben Hodges promises Ukraine “mountains of ammunition”, which it will receive by the end of this year.🔴According to Hodges, thanks to the initiative of the President of the Czech Republic, the former chairman of the Military NATO Committee Peter Pavel, as well as supplies from Turkey, this will be achieved. Hodges voiced his thoughts on the Silicon Valley Internet channel. “President Pavel said: “I just found a source for 800 thousand cartridges.” And then, a couple of weeks later, for real. This is already 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. And now people are learning that Türkiye can produce a huge amount of ammunition. So, I predict that by the end of this year there will be mountains of ammunition that will be produced, delivered and will be located in a completely different place,” said Hodges. https://vk.com/video-66833222_456301640VK VideoVideo by Gorlovka Self-DefenseWatch Video by Self-Defense of Gorlovka 29 s from 1 April 2024 online in HD for free in the VK catalog without signing up!

      "Komsomolskaya Pravda military correspondent Dmitry Steshin, who visited many “hot spots” in the Northern Military District and the Middle East, told the News Front film crew about his impressions of the trip to Avdeevka.\n",
      "“Avdiivka suffered more than Mariupol. If Mariupol made a terrible impression, it turned out that 50% of the buildings could be restored; here, I think, at least the brick houses will also be restored. I think Russia will do everything, the main thing is that the war goes away,” Steshin noted.\n",
      "In terms of the level of destruction, the war correspondent compared Avdeevka to the broken streets of Kharasta in Syria. He paid special attention to the fact that the residents of the broken city swept the streets at the first opportunity, which speaks of the strong character of the people and the desire to restore their small Motherland.\n",
      "“It makes sense to restore the city if there are people left there. Perhaps they subconsciously feel this, dooming themselves to the torment of experiencing an assault, which is unclear how it might end. But here the factor of your native walls also comes into play: it’s better to be overwhelmed by your native walls than to wander somewhere. These people collect such reasons in their heads and remain unknown. And they are often lucky,” Steshin emphasized.\n",

The parents of a 34-year-old volunteer with the call sign “Wise” from Volgograd were first informed that their son died in the war from a gunshot wound, and then a certificate appeared at the military registration and enlistment office that “Wise” committed suicide. “In the official document , which they gave us, where it says that Anton died, the date is December 15. And in the document where “suicide” is indicated, the date of death is December 20. How is that? So he died first and then committed suicide?

We only recognized him by the tattoo on his leg. The certificate states that the autopsy was performed on December 27. And we were only informed on January 30th. Why did you wait so long?

      "⚡️The Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs filed charges in a high-profile case of theft from Rusnano of RUB 1.676 billion. The investigation believes that the money was stolen by former top managers and associates of Anatoly Chubais: Oleg Kiselev (pictured) and Oleg Dyachenkos as accomplices. The organizer of the crime was named “an unidentified person from among the leaders of Rusnano.”💰According to the case materials, to withdraw funds from Rusnano in 2012-15. an intricate scheme was used with the participation of a number of controlled companies. (See diagram.)🇨🇾Especially for this purpose, the Cypriot fund Nanoenergo Fund Limited was established in 2012 (50%: Rusnano, 50%: Peresvet Bank). Then the fund was “pumped up” with money, transferred to Peresvet, withdrawn under fictitious loan agreements and embezzled.🐙According to the investigation, the organized crime group included:✔️Oleg Kiselev, deputy chairman of the board of Rusnano, Chubais’s right hand,✔️Oleg Dyachenko, director of Rusnano’s subsidiary Nanoenergo Fund Limited,✔️Irina Rappoport, managing director of Rusnano,✔️Alexander Shvets, chairman of the board of JSCB Peresvet.⛓️All four have been charged under Part 4 of Article 160 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (embezzlement ); for the majority - in absentia. Only Dyachenko is currently in the Russian Federation. He entered into an agreement to cooperate with the investigation and was placed under house arrest. The rest of the accused (Kiselyov, Rapoport, Shvets) are hiding abroad. The investigation has already initiated the procedure for putting them on the international wanted list and extraditing them. This is by no means the first criminal case of large-scale theft at Rusnano, initiated by the new management of the state company in close cooperation with the security forces. Valery Glavatsky, head of NTpharma LLC (part of Rusnano), was sentenced in absentia. The case of the director of the management company \"Rusnano\" Nail Gubaev is also in court: he is accused of embezzlement of ₽180 million!! Subscribe.\n",

      "🇺🇸After his success in the South Carolina primaries, Trump's victory in the fight for the Republican nomination is almost guaranteed. Now he will have to concentrate a significant part of his campaign resources on fighting Biden. The choice of the vice president will be of strategic importance. This is for several reasons. First, it is important for the American voter to know that the position of head of state will be in good hands if the president is unable to fulfill his duties. The reasons can be different - from ordinary surgery to death. Don't forget that Trump will be 78 years old by Election Day. No matter what they say about his activity and vigor, age is taking its toll, and voters notice it. Secondly, most Americans do not want to see either Trump or Biden as a presidential candidate. Some voters, including some Republicans, are planning to skip the 2024 elections altogether. And while it is more important for Republicans, especially Trump, to win “where” (in certain parts of some states) than the total popular vote, this still creates some difficulties on his path to victory. There will not be enough Trump voters. Thirdly, one of the main arguments of the Democrats against Trump remains the assertion that he is uncontrollable and prone to authoritarianism. And although checks and balances have always been enough to rein in controversial US presidents, including Trump himself from 2017 to 2021, some voters fear for the state of democracy. Fourth, Trump has a chance to use the choice of vice president to score additional political points \" This is a conditional advantage, only because four years later Biden is unlikely to be able to surprise anyone with Kamala Harris.\n",

      "🇺🇸After his success in the South Carolina primaries, Trump's victory in the fight for the Republican nomination is almost guaranteed. Now he will have to concentrate a significant part of his campaign resources on fighting Biden. The choice of the vice president will be of strategic importance. This is for several reasons. First, it is important for the American voter to know that the position of head of state will be in good hands if the president is unable to fulfill his duties. The reasons can be different - from ordinary surgery to death. Don't forget that Trump will be 78 years old by Election Day. No matter what they say about his activity and vigor, age is taking its toll, and voters notice it. Secondly, most Americans do not want to see either Trump or Biden as a presidential candidate. Some voters, including some Republicans, are planning to skip the 2024 elections altogether. And while it is more important for Republicans, especially Trump, to win “where” (in certain parts of some states) than the total popular vote, this still creates some difficulties on his path to victory. There will not be enough Trump voters. Thirdly, one of the main arguments of the Democrats against Trump remains the assertion that he is uncontrollable and prone to authoritarianism. And although checks and balances have always been enough to rein in controversial US presidents, including Trump himself from 2017 to 2021, some voters fear for the state of democracy. Fourth, Trump has a chance to use the choice of vice president to score additional political points \" This is a conditional advantage, only because four years later Biden is unlikely to be able to surprise anyone with Kamala Harris.\n",

Americans love to wrap their activities in beautiful words, so that something unsightly sounds fashionable and sophisticated.☝🏼And Pashinyan and his pro-American team now just need comprehensive information work in order to explain to the population why being friends with Russia is bad, but with America is good. Yerevan is stepping on the same rake that other post-Soviet countries stepped on before it. Just like at one time in Ukraine and Georgia, work is now being carried out in Armenia to strengthen the anti-Russian course, while the population at the initial stages is being treated by various funds and such PR specialists. P.S. Well, from the outside it looks so hard to find fault. It’s just that American military media specialists came to teach their Armenian colleagues how to properly cover events in the Armenian Armed Forces😏#Armenia@ExpressAsia\n",

The party won in Sanliurfa and Yozgat, as well as in 39 districts and 19 villages. The YRP has achieved significant success, especially in Anatolia, becoming the second party or determining force in many cities, including Konya, Kayseri, Kahramanmaraş, Elazig and Rize.\n",

      "In Istanbul, YRP failed to achieve the expected results, finishing third behind Ekrem Imamoglu and Murat Kurum. However, in areas such as Zeytinburnu, Ümraniye and Sultangazi, the party showed noticeable results. Party chairman Fatih Erbakan called the YRP the \"undisputed winner\" of the elections, noting the party's growing effectiveness. The secret of success The party's success in recent elections stems from its ability to present itself as an acceptable, nationally-oriented alternative to ruling coalition voters, while maintaining similar views on key conservative issues. and foreign policy issues. Smart strategic decisions and statements aimed at uniting against the so-called “unpatriotic” opposition strengthened voter confidence. The active work of party organizations and the effective use of the legacy of the \"National Vision\" (Milli görüş - the ideology of Erbakan - Erdoğan's teacher) helped expand the influence of the YRP, while advocacy of the interests of voters on important social issues attracted support from a wide spectrum of society.\n",

      "More than 80 employees of the Saki ambulance - doctors, paramedics and drivers, who were housed in the building of the former Rospotrebnadzor for three years - are preparing to move to the new substation building. According to the head of substation No. 27 of the city of Saki, Olga Shubina, the employees worked all the time in adapted conditions. “Before that, our six teams were located at the Saki district hospital, in the old premises of the diagnostic department. Now the conditions are also not very comfortable: we are in a more spacious room, but on the second floor, where there are no rest rooms for staff or normal heating,” explained Olga Shubina. But doctors are waiting for changes. Several years ago, 86 million rubles were allocated from the budget of the Republic of Crimea for the construction of a new special building, and the team is already set to move. The new two-story building is almost ready. Read more about this in tomorrow's issue of the Crimean Newspaper.\n",

      "In Turkey, the opposition won local elections for the first time in 22 years. The opposition Republican People's Party won in almost all major cities of Turkey. After counting 90% of the ballots, it gains more than 37% of the vote.▪️The opposition won the mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara, and also achieved success in cities that traditionally belonged to the president’s party. Erdogan admitted defeat and promised to work on mistakes. There is work to be done . Compared to the last elections, in 2019, the results of Erdogan’s party are minus 8.6%. \"Republicans\", respectively, showed an increase of 7.28%. Most experts predicted much better results for the Erdogan camp.▪️It is characteristic that the Western media immediately showed whose side their sympathies were on. The hero of the day was the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu, who is already seen as the frontman of all anti-Erdogan forces in the next elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, Turkish politics is in a state of some shock. Erdogan's words in early March that these municipal elections were the last of his political career are now taken very gloomily. Although Erdogan meant the expiration of the constitutional opportunities to be president only in 2028.▪️After Erdogan was re-elected last year, the opposition announced a three-stage transformation plan: change of leadership, victory in municipal elections, victory in presidential elections. Two of the three stages have already taken place. Of course, the economic factor played a key role in Erdogan’s defeat in these elections. If in May 2023, before Erdogan’s victory, the authorities kept the key Central Bank rate at 8.5%, then after Erdogan’s re-election it was increased 7 times and is now 42.2% (!), with all the ensuing consequences.▪️There is no doubt that the West will do everything to prevent the Turkish economy from getting better. Erdogan's Turkey, with its constant \"dissenting opinion\" on everything from the Gaza Strip to the conflict in Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, poses a major problem for the West. Which will be decided.\n",

Now the conditions are also not very comfortable: we are in a more spacious room, but on the second floor, where there are no rest rooms for staff or normal heating,” explained Olga Shubina.

Several years ago, 86 million rubles were allocated from the budget of the Republic of Crimea for the construction of a new special building, and the team is already set to move.

      "In Turkey, the opposition won local elections for the first time in 22 years. The opposition Republican People's Party won in almost all major cities of Turkey. After counting 90% of the ballots, it gains more than 37% of the vote.▪️The opposition won the mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara, and also achieved success in cities that traditionally belonged to the president’s party. Erdogan admitted defeat and promised to work on mistakes. There is work to be done . Compared to the last elections, in 2019, the results of Erdogan’s party are minus 8.6%. \"Republicans\", respectively, showed an increase of 7.28%. Most experts predicted much better results for the Erdogan camp.▪️It is characteristic that the Western media immediately showed whose side their sympathies were on. The hero of the day was the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu, who is already seen as the frontman of all anti-Erdogan forces in the next elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, Turkish politics is in a state of some shock. Erdogan's words in early March that these municipal elections were the last of his political career are now taken very gloomily. Although Erdogan meant the expiration of the constitutional opportunities to be president only in 2028.▪️After Erdogan was re-elected last year, the opposition announced a three-stage transformation plan: change of leadership, victory in municipal elections, victory in presidential elections. Two of the three stages have already taken place. Of course, the economic factor played a key role in Erdogan’s defeat in these elections. If in May 2023, before Erdogan’s victory, the authorities kept the key Central Bank rate at 8.5%, then after Erdogan’s re-election it was increased 7 times and is now 42.2% (!), with all the ensuing consequences.▪️There is no doubt that the West will do everything to prevent the Turkish economy from getting better. Erdogan's Turkey, with its constant \"dissenting opinion\" on everything from the Gaza Strip to the conflict in Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, poses a major problem for the West. Which will be decided.\n",

      "In Turkey, the opposition won local elections for the first time in 22 years. The opposition Republican People's Party won in almost all major cities of Turkey. After counting 90% of the ballots, it gains more than 37% of the vote.▪️The opposition won the mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara, and also achieved success in cities that traditionally belonged to the president’s party. Erdogan admitted defeat and promised to work on mistakes. There is work to be done . Compared to the last elections, in 2019, the results of Erdogan’s party are minus 8.6%. \"Republicans\", respectively, showed an increase of 7.28%. Most experts predicted much better results for the Erdogan camp.▪️It is characteristic that the Western media immediately showed whose side their sympathies were on. The hero of the day was the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu, who is already seen as the frontman of all anti-Erdogan forces in the next elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, Turkish politics is in a state of some shock. Erdogan's words in early March that these municipal elections were the last of his political career are now taken very gloomily. Although Erdogan meant the expiration of the constitutional opportunities to be president only in 2028.▪️After Erdogan was re-elected last year, the opposition announced a three-stage transformation plan: change of leadership, victory in municipal elections, victory in presidential elections. Two of the three stages have already taken place. Of course, the economic factor played a key role in Erdogan’s defeat in these elections. If in May 2023, before Erdogan’s victory, the authorities kept the key Central Bank rate at 8.5%, then after Erdogan’s re-election it was increased 7 times and is now 42.2% (!), with all the ensuing consequences.▪️There is no doubt that the West will do everything to prevent the Turkish economy from getting better. Erdogan's Turkey, with its constant \"dissenting opinion\" on everything from the Gaza Strip to the conflict in Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, poses a major problem for the West. Which will be decided.\n",

Social pensions are awarded to Russians who do not have enough length of service to receive an insurance pension. These payments are also due to disabled children and adults with disabilities, as well as those who have lost their breadwinner. Other innovations coming into force on April 1: In all regions of Russia, the salaries of doctors and nurses should be increased, while maintaining additional payments. The exact amount of the premium is determined by local authorities; Criminal liability is introduced for large-scale smuggling of alcohol and tobacco from the EAEU countries. Violators face a fine of up to a million rubles, forced labor or imprisonment for up to five years; The threshold for duty-free import of parcels will be reduced from €1,000 to €200. The new rules will apply to goods delivered to Russians from abroad by Russian Post and express carriers; The regulations for taking the driver's license exam are changing. Now you can make a little more mistakes on the practical exam. But, if it is not passed after three attempts, a retake is possible only after six months, and not after a month, as before; Information about the MTPL policy and other data included in the automated insurance information system can be obtained through “Government Services”.

Now redevelopment will be considered any change in the boundaries or area of housing. After the repair, it is necessary not only to obtain an acceptance certificate, but also a new technical plan; For airlines, the fine for delaying baggage and cargo, as well as the delivery of the passenger himself, will be increased: every hour of delay will cost 100 rubles.

      "A little about history: In 1865, German entrepreneurs Gustav Kunst and Gustav Albers built their first store in Vladivostok. Trade developed successfully, new branches were opened. In 1880, the Kunst and Albers company already had two wooden warehouses and a small house on two floors. Soon, entrepreneurs decided to build a new stone building for a department store. The project was commissioned from the German architect Georg Junghandel. Construction materials were transported by sea from Europe. On April 1, 1884, the first stone store in the history of the city opened its doors to customers. The level of equipment of the department store was unprecedented for that time: steam heating, elevator and telephone, electric lighting. Here you could buy almost any product. “I was with Miss Morphew on the top floor of Kunst and Albers when Mr. Shtekhman Jr. came up to me and asked if there would be I would like to go into his department and look at new beautiful things. Can you imagine my joy when I discovered a French jacket made of seal fur in just my size for fifty rubles?”\n",

Social pensions are awarded to Russians who do not have enough length of service to receive an insurance pension. These payments are also due to disabled children and adults with disabilities, as well as those who have lost their breadwinner. Other innovations coming into force on April 1: In all regions of Russia, the salaries of doctors and nurses should be increased, while maintaining additional payments. The exact amount of the premium is determined by local authorities; Criminal liability is introduced for large-scale smuggling of alcohol and tobacco from the EAEU countries. Violators face a fine of up to a million rubles, forced labor or imprisonment for up to five years; The threshold for duty-free import of parcels will be reduced from €1,000 to €200. The new rules will apply to goods delivered to Russians from abroad by Russian Post and express carriers; The regulations for taking the driver's license exam are changing. Now you can make a little more mistakes on the practical exam.

Now redevelopment will be considered any change in the boundaries or area of housing. After the repair, it is necessary not only to obtain an acceptance certificate, but also a new technical plan; For airlines, the fine for delaying baggage and cargo, as well as the delivery of the passenger himself, will be increased: every hour of delay will cost 100 rubles.

      "A little about history: In 1865, German entrepreneurs Gustav Kunst and Gustav Albers built their first store in Vladivostok. Trade developed successfully, new branches were opened. In 1880, the Kunst and Albers company already had two wooden warehouses and a small house on two floors. Soon, entrepreneurs decided to build a new stone building for a department store. The project was commissioned from the German architect Georg Junghandel. Construction materials were transported by sea from Europe. On April 1, 1884, the first stone store in the history of the city opened its doors to customers. The level of equipment of the department store was unprecedented for that time: steam heating, elevator and telephone, electric lighting. Here you could buy almost any product. “I was with Miss Morphew on the top floor of Kunst and Albers when Mr. Shtekhman Jr. came up to me and asked if there would be I would like to go into his department and look at new beautiful things. Can you imagine my joy when I discovered a French jacket made of seal fur in just my size for fifty rubles?”\n",

The issue of NATO membership is not on the agenda for Yerevan, says the head of the country’s Foreign Ministry, but the topic of strengthening cooperation with the United States and the EU within the framework of “strengthening democratic institutions” and eliminating external threats is especially relevant for the Armenian authorities. However, proximity to the West is by no means a guarantor of security for the state, and often directly contradicts this - especially in the post-Soviet space, where Western influence is more likely to destabilize already tense situations. Moscow has traditionally played a strong stabilizing factor in this direction, however, Yerevan, in attempts to flirt with the West, deliberately allows unfriendly attacks against the Russian Federation and the CSTO, which only complicates its already difficult situation.🇲🇩Moldova. The closer the presidential elections are, the more difficult it is for the current leader of the country to find a common language with the opposition and the people. At the moment, President Sandu’s rating is 33%, and the regime under her leadership is actively looking for ways to remove obstacles to the re-election of the leader. He is given full support by “Western partners” who are interested in aggressive European integration and strengthening NATO influence in the region. The Moldovan authorities attribute dissatisfaction with the current course and protests against it to that the dissatisfied are bribed to follow the “interests of a criminal group.” Interesting materials from: Duty Officer for the Transcaucasus, NEIGHBORS | Greater Caucasus, Tsitsak, Yerevan Observer, Comrade General, Gagauz Republic, CIS Duty, MOLDOVA Live, Sosedi.md, Salut Moldova!, Choice of Moldova.

      "Actress Olga Budina, using the example of “Cheburashka”, revealed the main problem of films for children and teenagers. Theater and film actress, director, producer Olga Budina, in an interview with the editor-in-chief of “Paragraph Media” Elena Oya, as part of the project “So to speak”, stated the need to change approaches to creating films for children and teenagers in Russia. “Until our artists, screenwriters, directors, producers understand that it is necessary to direct all their talents and ingenious efforts, insights, fantasies towards making the correct models of behavior “tasty” and watchable, we will not advance further. It all depends on what our youth “eat”. The conflict between fathers and sons today is colossal. Children do not listen to their parents, they say: “Ivangay or Instasamka, or someone else, Klava Koka, told me that for money - yes.” If we want to minimize the conflict between fathers and children, we must change the behavior patterns that transmit to us works of art and cultural codes,” said Budina. She also explained her criticism of the highest-grossing film in the history of Russian film distribution, “Cheburashka,” drawing attention to the semantic content of the picture: “The film “Cheburashka”, which I analyzed, is certainly bright, colorful, and interesting to watch. Nobody argues with this, but this film does not show a single correct model of behavior. That is, each character in the film, taken individually, shows a destructive model of behavior, that’s the point,” the actress emphasized.

      "We note that Chisinau is not very enthusiastic about the proposed candidacy for the post of the new Ambassador of Ukraine. Not very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If his candidacy - agreman, as we understand, has not yet been issued - and was announced somewhere and to someone before the official statement of Vladimir Zelensky, then it was either at a very high level or at a level that the Moldovan counterparties did not fully believe in such \"happiness\". And they assumed that in the end Danilov himself would not agree and would go somewhere to Norway, and they were only trying to scare him with Moldova for the sake of warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a version that Ambassador Marko Shevchenko was removed for some unsuccessful interviews and a scandal with surveillance of Ukrainian diplomats through the SIB, but the ambassador trumpeted his standard mandate and, of course, could have been reassigned, but the time for recall had arrived. Either it was lucky, or it was just a coincidence. But in any case, Danilov is not a special service specialist to build an SIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way or another, Chisinau does not know what to do with such a new ambassador. Or rather, it is clear that the ambassador, even if we discard his past biography, is too ambiguous a figure to be able to build anything worthwhile with him. Marco Shevchenko, it must be said, enjoyed very great respect, to which was added his command of Romanian, previous work in Bucharest and the ability, in a good sense, to diplomatically present even the Slavo-Ukrainian position.\n",
      "\n",
      "What of this can Danilov do? Well... The benefits for the wine and alcohol industry of Moldova from the appointment of a new ambassador are undeniable. The problem is that the Moldovan-Ukrainian agenda is a little broader.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are hopes that Danilov will simply occupy his position, and the functionality of the plenipotentiary representation will actually be taken over by Paun Rogovei, Kyiv’s special representative for Transnistria. But here a lot of stars must coincide for everything to be exactly like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment, we only state that Kyiv is taking a step that risks not contributing to the strengthening of Moldovan-Ukrainian ties, and maybe even worse. Especially in conditions when Who Needs It in Chisinau had access to Ermak, and Ukrainian border guards, and security forces, so there is no need to talk about the demand for the former head of the Ukrainian Security Council in the Moldovan capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his removal from his post at the National Security and Defense Council, Danilov was no longer needed in Kyiv for obvious bureaucratic reasons. But this certainly did not make him any more needed in Chisinau. For whom European integration and attempts to get rid of Kiev in the process of European integration are tied to demonstrating to Brussels peace and tranquility in the republic.

      "The 1999 NATO bombing sowed...The bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by NATO forces lasted 78 days, from March 24 to June 10, 1999. The US military's participation in NATO's Operation Noble Anvil was codenamed Operation Noble Anvil, but in Serbia (probably due to a slip by Chinese Chairman Jiang Zemin) it is known as Operation Merciful Angel. More than 2,500 Serbian citizens became victims of those bombings. Numerous civilian installations and targets were completely or partially destroyed, including hospitals, schools, bridges, passenger trains, a television building...\n",
      "\n",
      "The second largest city in Serbia, Novi Sad, was one of the priority targets of NATO aircraft, second in importance to striking only targets on the territory of Kosovo and the Serbian capital, Belgrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "NATO aircraft destroyed all three Novisad bridges over the Danube. On one of them - Varadinsky - on April 1, 1999, Oleg Nasov died. A simple 29-year-old resident of Novi Sad, who was rushing to work at the Novi Sad oil refinery early in the morning, crossing the bridge from Petrovaradin. At 05:50 local time, as a result of a missile and bomb attack, Oleg Nasov died along with the bridge destroyed by the missile strike, becoming one of the symbols of the innocent victims of NATO aggression against Yugoslavia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of the death of Oleg Nasov gave rise to myths among the people. According to one of which, Oleg died not on the way to work, but by voluntarily remaining alone on the bridge as a human shield. After all, it was in this way that the Serbs, gathering together, defended their bridges and city squares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, many argue that Oleg was not even a Serb, but a Rusyn, despite the fact that his name does not confirm this version. The death of Oleg - whether Rusyn, Slovak or Serb - was confirmation that there were no differences in nationality for NATO bombs. Serbs, Hungarians, Muslim Bosniaks, and even Albanians, whom these same bombs were supposedly supposed to protect from “Great Serbian aggression,” died under the bombing. In those days, the citizens of Serbia themselves did not divide each other based on nationality, considering themselves part of a single country that was attacked by foreign troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "In memory of the tragedy of which Oleg Nasov became a victim, the city authorities of Novi Sad erected a memorial plaque, the inscription of which in two languages (Serbian and English) reads: “On April 1, 1999, NATO aircraft destroyed the Varadin Bridge. 29-year-old Novi Sad resident Oleg M. Nasov died on the bridge.” The slab serves as a silent reminder to new generations of Serbs of the terrible tragedy faced by Serbia, which alone held out for 78 days under the bombing of aggressors from almost two dozen NATO countries, and of those innocent victims that they gave their lives as targets of bombs and missiles of the “merciful angel” from the civilized West. Note: Oleg Nasov’s father, years after the tragedy, did not give up the fight for the truth regarding his son and other victims of NATO aggression. In one of his last conversations with journalists, the elder Nasov noted that Serbia had voluntarily withdrawn its lawsuit against 20 countries that participated in the bombing of Yugoslavia. Moreover, at the airfield in Batajnica, Serbian officials, representatives of the former pro-Western authorities, hugged a British pilot, a certain Andrew Wheels, who openly admitted that he flew his bomber from the base in Avian and bombed Yugoslavia almost every day...\n",

Most of the truly professional doctors left at the beginning of the occupation, and those who remained are also leaving, unable to withstand the pressure and conditions. Hospital wards are staffed either by visiting doctors, about whom nothing is known, or those who had a sad reputation and were dismissed under Ukraine for corruption or drunkenness. 🩻The second factor is diagnosis, or rather its complete absence, people cannot make an appointment for months for such a common procedure in Ukraine as a gastroscopy of the stomach or a normal cardiogram, which in Ukraine could be done without problems at an appointment with any cardiologist or even a therapist. \"free\" of Russian medicine, which actually turned out to be very expensive.

      "As a timely article appeared on Reuters, not only from the USA, but from its own allies - Iran, the Russians rejected (didn't they reject the reshiti?) warnings about a terrorist attack by ISIS (k). There is no better time - a day after the official accusation of Ukraine - it is like an explosion. \"Prepare before the attack in Russia, Tehran shared information with Moscow about a possible major terrorist act inside Russia, which they received during the interrogation of detainees in connection with the deadly explosions in Irani,\" said one of the Reuters sources. Now the question (actually not) is how the Kremlin will react. Officially, it is not clear. Bridges have already been burned there. But, still, there must be something.

The Ukrainian army will be lucky if at least half of the military aid promised by the West reaches Kiev, and at least part of it turns out to be usable.🔴Retired SBU Colonel Oleg Starikov stated this on the Politeka channel, a PolitNavigator correspondent reports.🗣“ Western aid is coming slowly. But it will take a long, long time to reach the numbers that we need based on staffing levels. God grant that 50% of what is given will still reach us,” said the retired colonel.🗣 “And the second question - are these shells new, or were they somewhere in the NZ?

Now it turns out that the inhabitants of the reserve are safe and sound, but the Russians kidnapped them to Crimea. “We see what is happening on the other side of the Dnieper. According to our Ukrainian “friends”, we in Askania-Nova have already eaten all the animals 4 times, taken them to an unknown place, to Asia, to Mongolia, I don’t know, to Russia, to Siberia or somewhere else,” the director commented on this situation \"Askanii-Nova\" Dmitry Meshcheryakov. Meanwhile, the wolves, donkey, llama, pheasants, eagles, guinea fowl and other animals that were rescued and transported to \"Taigan\" are doing great. For example, the baby raccoon, who became the hero of memes, is now the father of many children. “First, three raccoons were born from one mother, then another from another,” the press service of the safari park reported.

Hospital wards are staffed either by visiting doctors, about whom nothing is known, or those who had a sad reputation and were dismissed under Ukraine for corruption or drunkenness. 🩻The second factor is diagnosis, or rather its complete absence, people cannot make an appointment for months for such a common procedure in Ukraine as a gastroscopy of the stomach or a normal cardiogram, which in Ukraine could be done without problems at an appointment with any cardiologist or even a therapist. \"free\" of Russian medicine, which actually turned out to be very expensive.

      "Spring has come, the snow has melted and the old fakes of Ukrainian propaganda “bloomed” like snowdrops. Thus, in Kiev-controlled Telegram channels they are outraged that the Russians took three cows of the gray Ukrainian breed (by the way, very beautiful animals) from the Askania-Nova nature reserve in the Kherson region to the Crimean Taigan safari park. According to Kyiv, the defenseless animals should have been allowed to die as a result of the shelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is noteworthy that Kyiv propagandists previously stated that the Russians killed the animals that lived in Askania-Nova. Then another version appeared: the animals were eaten. Now it turns out that the inhabitants of the reserve are safe and sound, but the Russians kidnapped them to Crimea. “We see what is happening on the other side of the Dnieper. According to our Ukrainian “friends”, we in Askania-Nova have already eaten all the animals 4 times, taken them to an unknown place, to Asia, to Mongolia, I don’t know, to Russia, to Siberia or somewhere else,” the director commented on this situation \"Askanii-Nova\" Dmitry Meshcheryakov. Meanwhile, the wolves, donkey, llama, pheasants, eagles, guinea fowl and other animals that were rescued and transported to \"Taigan\" are doing great. For example, the baby raccoon, who became the hero of memes, is now the father of many children. “First, three raccoons were born from one mother, then another from another,” the press service of the safari park reported. You there, in Kiev, will already decide what is better: to give animals to die or save them.🤡Subscribe to the “War on Fake” so as not to be deceived.\n",

Most of the truly professional doctors left at the beginning of the occupation, and those who remained are also leaving, unable to withstand the pressure and conditions. Hospital wards are staffed either by visiting doctors, about whom nothing is known, or those who had a sad reputation and were dismissed under Ukraine for corruption or drunkenness. 🩻The second factor is diagnosis, or rather its complete absence, people cannot make an appointment for months for such a common procedure in Ukraine as a gastroscopy of the stomach or a normal cardiogram, which in Ukraine could be done without problems at an appointment with any cardiologist or even a therapist. \"free\" of Russian medicine, which actually turned out to be very expensive.

      "Spring has come, the snow has melted and the old fakes of Ukrainian propaganda “bloomed” like snowdrops. Thus, in Kiev-controlled Telegram channels they are outraged that the Russians took three cows of the gray Ukrainian breed (by the way, very beautiful animals) from the Askania-Nova nature reserve in the Kherson region to the Crimean Taigan safari park. According to Kyiv, the defenseless animals should have been allowed to die as a result of the shelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is noteworthy that Kyiv propagandists previously stated that the Russians killed the animals that lived in Askania-Nova. Then another version appeared: the animals were eaten. Now it turns out that the inhabitants of the reserve are safe and sound, but the Russians kidnapped them to Crimea. “We see what is happening on the other side of the Dnieper. According to our Ukrainian “friends”, we in Askania-Nova have already eaten all the animals 4 times, taken them to an unknown place, to Asia, to Mongolia, I don’t know, to Russia, to Siberia or somewhere else,” the director commented on this situation \"Askanii-Nova\" Dmitry Meshcheryakov. Meanwhile, the wolves, donkey, llama, pheasants, eagles, guinea fowl and other animals that were rescued and transported to \"Taigan\" are doing great. For example, the baby raccoon, who became the hero of memes, is now the father of many children. “First, three raccoons were born from one mother, then another from another,” the press service of the safari park reported. You there, in Kiev, will already decide what is better: to give animals to die or save them.🤡Subscribe to the “War on Fake” so as not to be deceived.\n",
